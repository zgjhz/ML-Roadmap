00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,570
Computer power has revolutionized
statistical inference.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,450
In this module, we look at the two main
concepts that are behind this revolution,

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,230
the Monte Carlo method and the bootstrap.

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,430
We will discuss the main principles
behind these methods and

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,030
then see how to apply them in
various important contexts,

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,280
such as in regression and for
constructing confidence intervals.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,710
Remember that very simple formula for the
confidence interval for a population mean.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,930
We simply take the sample mean
plus minus z times standard error.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,920
The reason why we used z
was because the sample mean

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,600
approximately follows the normal curve.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,270
Now what happens if we're interested
in a different estimator,

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,140
let's call it theta hat, for
some parameter, theta, of the population.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,020
And the normal approximation is
not valid for this estimator.

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,230
In that case, such a simple formula
is not applicable anymore, and

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,560
we have to do something else.

16
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,200
Likewise the simple formula for
the standard error of the mean,

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,000
which was based on the square root law,
may not work anymore.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,770
So then what's the standard
error in that case?

19
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,720
It turns out that in such situations,

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,660
simulations can be used to
estimate those quantities.

21
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,070
In fact, it may turn out that simulations
sometimes result in better estimates.

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,520
That what we would have gotten,
if we would be able to use the formula for

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,580
the normal approximation.
