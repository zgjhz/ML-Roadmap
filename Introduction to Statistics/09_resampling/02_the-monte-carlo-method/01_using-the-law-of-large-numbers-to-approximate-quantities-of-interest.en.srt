00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,085
Let's look at a simple example to see what the famous Monte Carlo Method does.

2
00:00:07,085 --> 00:00:11,980
What's the average height of all people living in the United States?

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,150
Well, this is impossible to determine exactly

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,125
because we would have to measure the heights of all people in the United States.

5
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:25,140
But we've already seen that we can actually estimate that average quite well.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,720
All we do is simply take a sample of size 100 and

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,000
then we use the average height of

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,305
that sample as an estimate of the average height of all the people.

9
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:44,145
Remember, we talk about a parameter like theta when we talk about the population.

10
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:49,145
So in this case, theta would be the average height of the population.

11
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:55,845
We estimate that parameter theta with a statistic which we call theta hat,

12
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:59,715
and that statistic is based on a sample.

13
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:05,190
In this case, our statistic would be simply the average of the sample.

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,300
We already know that the sample mean tends to be close to

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,130
the population mean even for moderate sample sizes such as 100,

16
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,105
and that's because of the law of large numbers.

17
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:21,630
This is a simple example of the Monte Carlo method.

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,210
Sometimes it's simply called simulation.

19
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,370
What that method does is,

20
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,600
it approximates a fixed quantity theta by the average

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,950
of independent random variables that have expected value equal to theta.

22
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,270
Then, by the law of large numbers,

23
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,050
the approximation error can be made as small

24
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,170
as you wish by using a large enough sample size.

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,840
It turns out that the Monte Carlo method can

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,060
also be used for more complicated quantities.

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,345
One quantity which is important in statistics is the standard error of a statistic.

28
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:58,675
Remember that the standard error tells you roughly

29
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:02,520
how far off the statistic will be from its expected value.

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,300
There's a formal definition of the standard error which is given there.

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,190
It's simply the square root of

32
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:14,475
the variance when we think about theta hat as a random variable.

33
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:20,405
So how would the Monte Carlo method work to estimate the standard error in this case?

34
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:23,715
In the first step, we would get many,

35
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:28,090
let's say 1,000 samples of 100 observations each.

36
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,110
Remember we take 100 observations each because

37
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:39,700
the standard error of Theta hat is based on 100 observations.

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,840
Next we compute theta hat for each of these 1,000 samples,

39
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,650
and that gives us 1,000 copies of

40
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:53,210
these estimates which we call theta hat 1 up to theta hat 1,000.

41
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:59,240
Finally, we simply compute the standard deviation of these 1,000 estimates.

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,790
The formula you see there is simply the formula for the standard deviation.

43
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:12,290
The average of these estimates is simply theta hat bar,

44
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,370
remember that the bar notation denotes averages.

45
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,810
I didn't want to put two superscripts on there to make it not too confusing,

46
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,005
so I wrote down the average of the theta hats.

47
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:27,790
So note this is not an average of independent random variables

48
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:33,220
because the average of the theta hats is part of each of these terms,

49
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,640
and so, that makes the whole thing dependent,

50
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,735
but the Monte Carlo method still works.

51
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:45,925
It turns out that this quantity is roughly equal to the standard error.

52
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:51,520
So while this example looks a bit more complicated than the previous one,

53
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,770
what's really going on here is,

54
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,075
that it's simply an application of the law of large numbers.

55
00:03:57,075 --> 00:04:00,580
But the caveat is that this method will only

56
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,275
work if we can draw many samples of size 100.

57
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:11,870
In other words, simulation works if I can sample as much as I wish.
