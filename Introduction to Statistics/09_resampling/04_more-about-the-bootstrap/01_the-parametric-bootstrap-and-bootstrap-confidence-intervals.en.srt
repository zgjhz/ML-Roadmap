00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,330
Drawing a bootstrap sample by sampling with

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,065
replacement from the data is called nonparametric bootstrap.

3
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:12,035
Sometimes, we know more about the data.

4
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:16,130
For example, we may know that the data follow a normal distribution,

5
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,115
but we don't know the mean on the standard deviation.

6
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:22,665
In that case, we may want to use that information.

7
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:25,160
Of course, the obvious thing to do there is to

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,505
simply estimate the unknown mean and standard deviation,

9
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:31,910
and then simply sample from the normal distribution,

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,160
with that mean and standard deviation.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,495
That's called parametric bootstrap.

12
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:42,465
This type of sampling works if the data are independent,

13
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:47,195
that is, X1 to Xn are really generated independently.

14
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:50,195
But oftentimes, there's dependence in the data.

15
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:53,540
For example, the data are observed over time.

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,020
There are also bootstrap methods for dealing with that,

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,515
but that's a somewhat specialized thing which we don't discuss here.

18
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:06,605
Remember, the simple formula for an approximate confidence interval.

19
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:12,570
We take theta hat and then we go a multiple z times the standard error in each direction.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,270
So, if we have a 1 - alpha for example,

21
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,440
if alpha is 5%,

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,980
we get a 95% confidence interval.

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,530
Then we would look Z alpha half,

24
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,950
so we would look at a normal curve and alpha half is 2.5%.

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:40,830
So, we would look at z, 0.025,

26
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,470
and we would simply plug this into

27
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,730
the formula and get an approximate 95% confidence interval.

28
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:54,510
We just saw how to estimate the standard error, in case there's no formula for it.

29
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,590
But remember, the confidence interval is really based on

30
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,310
the assumption that the sampling distribution of theta hat is roughly normal.

31
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,325
That's the reason why we use the multiplier Z from the normal curve.

32
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:12,940
What happens if theta hat is not approximately normal?

33
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,075
Well, it turns out we can use the bootstrap in a more ambitious way.

34
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:19,570
In fact, we can estimate

35
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,335
the whole sampling distribution of theta hat, not just the standard error.

36
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:27,750
The idea is that the sampling distribution of

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,120
theta hat should be close to that of the bootstrap copies.

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,630
And the sampling distribution to the bootstrap copies I can get

39
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,780
simply by generating many bootstrap copies and making a histogram of those.

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,885
This histogram may be quite far from normal.

41
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:50,420
For example, it might look skewed like this.

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,995
But I can simply find a 95% confidence interval by looking up

43
00:02:56,995 --> 00:03:03,955
95% in the middle and looking at the appropriate cutoff points at each end.

44
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:07,555
This is called the bootstrap percentile interval.

45
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,915
You simply look up the right percentiles on

46
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:15,590
each end so you have 1 - alpha in the middle.

47
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,730
An alternative way to do that is not to bootstrap the distribution of

48
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,710
theta hat, but to bootstrap the distribution of theta hat - theta.

49
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,540
Why would one do that?

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,595
The hope is that this is less sensitive to the particular value of theta,

51
00:03:33,595 --> 00:03:38,125
and therefore it may produce a more accurate confidence interval.

52
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,960
The resulting confidence interval is called

53
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,860
bootstrap pivotal interval, and the formula is given there.
