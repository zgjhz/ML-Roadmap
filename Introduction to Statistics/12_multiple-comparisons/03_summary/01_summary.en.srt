1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
We have reached the end of the course.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,310
We have discussed the key ideas for learning from data and assessing uncertainty.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,785
We looked at the important concepts that are behind

4
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:12,690
almost every statistical inference, such as

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,665
the square root law and the basic rules of probability.

6
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:20,045
We also saw how modern computer-intensive procedures such as the bootstrap

7
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:22,175
can be a big help for inference.

8
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:25,190
We discussed the main statistical procedures that come

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,040
up in analyzing data such as regression,

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,325
testing, and the analysis of categorical data.

11
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:36,830
We also discussed how to effectively communicate information by visualizing data.

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,950
Even advanced methods in machine learning use

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,670
these basic ideas in one way or another, and chances are,

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,330
that when you look under the hood of new methodology that you encounter in the future,

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,775
you will recognize a number of ideas that we discussed in this course.

16
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:55,190
You now have the background to take the machine

17
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,120
learning course, or an advanced statistics course.

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,410
I wish you the best with your future learning.
