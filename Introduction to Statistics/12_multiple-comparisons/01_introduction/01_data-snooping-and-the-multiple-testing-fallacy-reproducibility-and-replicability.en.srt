00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,530
The era of big data has led to a crisis of replicability and

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,750
reproducibility, which has hit

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,265
the mainstream news and which has even led some to question the scientific method.

4
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:14,010
We will discuss some of the important causes of

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,180
these problems and how to guard against them in doing statistical analysis.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,800
So, what is data snooping?

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,840
Let's look at a famous Swedish study from 1992

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,145
which examined whether living near a power line causes adverse health effects.

9
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:37,640
That study reported a statistically highly significant increase in childhood leukemia.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,050
But then curiously, when people followed up on

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,130
that study, it turned out they couldn't really confirm that result.

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:52,600
So why then did that study result in such a statistically significant outcome?

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,055
To understand what's going on,

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:01:00,050
we have to keep in mind that the study looked at 800 different health effects.

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,900
That means the way to think about it is that

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,350
the study did 800 different statistical tests.

17
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,480
Remember that the p-value summarizes the evidence for an effect.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,885
And the interpretation is that the smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence.

19
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:26,130
In particular, if the p-value is smaller than 1%, than one says,

20
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,735
that the test is highly significant.

21
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:31,285
But keep in mind what that means.

22
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:33,805
It means that if there's no effect,

23
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:38,895
then there's still a 1% chance to get such a highly significant outcome.

24
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:42,910
So, that means that if we do 800 tests,

25
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,640
then even if there's nothing going on at all,

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,030
we would expect to see about 800 times 1% which

27
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,470
is roughly 8 highly significant outcomes just by chance.

28
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,445
This is what happened in that Swedish study.

29
00:01:57,445 --> 00:02:00,440
They did so many tests that they found

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,705
highly significant outcomes, even if there's nothing going on there.

31
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:08,790
This effect has a name, it's called the multiple

32
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,530
testing fallacy or the look-elsewhere effect.

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,920
With the large amounts of data that are available nowadays,

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,510
it's very easy to fall into this trap.

35
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,030
The reason is that there are just so many potential relationships one can look into,

36
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,270
that one sooner or later will run across a test which is significant just by chance.

37
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,835
This behavior is called data snooping.

38
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:37,760
One way people find out that data snooping was done is,

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,345
if they cannot replicate the study.

40
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:46,050
Replicating means to get the same conclusion with slightly different samples,

41
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,380
procedures, and data analysis methods.

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,770
Related to that is the problem of reproducibility.

43
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,400
That means to get the same results then you simply use

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,750
the same data and same methods that were claimed in the analysis.

45
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,465
In past years, there have been some high profile publications

46
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:10,185
that discuss the lack of replicability and reproducibility.

47
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:13,295
Two interesting papers are,

48
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:14,930
"How Science Goes Wrong",

49
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,800
which is an article in The Economist, and the research paper,

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,800
"Why Most Published Research Findings are False" by John Ioannidis.
