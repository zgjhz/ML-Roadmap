1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,110
For each observation, we have an observed y-value and we have a predicted y-value.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,845
The difference between these two y-values is called the residual.

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:17,655
Residuals are useful for checking whether the regression we're doing is appropriate.

4
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:22,000
The main tool here is what's called the residual plot.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,640
It is simply a scatter plot of the residuals against the x-values.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,145
Here's an example.

7
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:35,330
We have midterm scores on the horizontal axis, and final scores on the vertical axis,

8
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,435
and we also see the regression line through the scatter.

9
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:41,380
Based on the regression line,

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,110
we can computer the residuals,

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,320
and those are shown on the right plot.

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,580
What we are seeing in the residual plot is a scatter that doesn't show any structure.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,465
That's just the way we would like to have it.

14
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:56,330
Here is another example where

15
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,455
the residual plot shows that regression might not be appropriate.

16
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:04,720
The left plot shows income versus education.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,220
And looking at the scatter,

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,785
you can already tell that there's a lot of curvature in there.

19
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:13,275
When we fit the regression and look at the residual plot,

20
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:16,895
we see a pattern that shows a big curve.

21
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:19,860
That's an indication that a scatter is not

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,205
linear and the regression shouldn't be applied.

23
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:25,180
However, not all is lost.

24
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:31,270
It may still be possible to use regression for those data after we transform those data.

25
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,140
For example, we could regress the square root of

26
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,865
income or the logarithm of income on education.

27
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:41,595
Sometimes, that results in a linear pattern,

28
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:44,840
and we can use regression on those transformed data,

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,690
and then we would simply transform back the results.

30
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:54,760
Here's another deviation of the linear scatter that a residual plot might catch.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,800
The scatter on the left-hand side is linear.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,610
So it roughly follows a line,

33
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,655
but we see that it looks like a fan shape. It opens up.

34
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:09,495
And that also shows up in the residual plot.

35
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:12,730
Such a scatter is called heteroscedastic.

36
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,080
It simply means that the variability changes with the x-values.

37
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,150
There's a little bit variability on the left side,

38
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,090
but there's a lot of variability on the right-hand side.

39
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,750
Those types of problems can oftentimes be fixed by transforming the y-values.

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,630
However, it may turn out that that transformation on

41
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,245
the y-values changes that scatter from linear to nonlinear.

42
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:41,755
So we may have to do another transformation on the x-values to fix that.

43
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:47,050
Here's an example from the 2000 presidential election in the United States.

44
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,930
The scatter on the left-hand side shows the election results for each county in Florida,

45
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,425
with the exception of Palm Beach County.

46
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,810
In the 2000 presidential election,

47
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,955
there was a third party candidate,

48
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:02,905
Pat Buchanan, who got a sizable proportion of the votes.

49
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:09,150
The scatter shows the votes that Bush got versus those that Buchanan got.

50
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,890
Just looking at the scatter,

51
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,355
It seems that it's roughly linear,

52
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:17,430
but when we look at the residual plot on the right hand side,

53
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,965
we see that it's heteroscedastic.

54
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:23,260
However, if we take logs of both variables,

55
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,245
we get a result that looks quite satisfactory.

56
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:29,845
In particular, notice when looking at a residual plot,

57
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:35,000
we get a horizontal band that doesn't show any structure.
