1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Traditional drug discovery is typically led by biologists.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,250
Right? And so, in a program like liver cancer that would, most typically,

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,445
entail someone who has spent their entire life studying the disease,

4
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:16,560
and maybe they come up with some piece of biology or

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,080
some mechanism that has the potential to be modulated,

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,915
right, to help people with that disease.

7
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:24,705
That type of research,

8
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:27,660
can take decades, a lot of basic science,

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,390
a lot of cognitive thinking.

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,210
We replace a lot of that work with data science.

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,550
We collect tons of data,

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,200
more data than any human could possibly ingest and interpret on their own,

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,370
process that information and essentially come up

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,580
with the same types of biological theories that you could apply.

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,110
But all this happens in the course of a few minutes,

16
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,995
rather than the course of a few decades.

17
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:55,525
The challenges we have at work have very little to do with technology choices,

18
00:00:55,525 --> 00:01:02,100
and generating potential new drugs that have promise.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,240
More of our challenge sare on, it's an industry that has a lot of tradition behind it,

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,075
of having that classic, lab coated

21
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:11,190
scientists doing that work.

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,540
And most of our work is helping to educate people that

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,840
data science can actually make this difference, right?

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,650
You don't need some prestigious professor who's been at it for 20 years,

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,285
that kind of software can do the same thing, if not better.

26
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:30,380
Like that concept, for people in this industry is a very tough one for them to deal with,

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,710
and even just in the medical profession as a whole, there's been,

28
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,835
I think a lot of talk about what is the role of the clinician, right?

29
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:40,925
What's the role of your doctor moving forward?

30
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:43,270
And does that become one where they're doing

31
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,070
less on decision support and software is doing that,

32
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,210
and it's more about sort of that personal care perspective.

33
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,770
Medical doctors don't like that.

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,660
They don't like that, and so, a lot of the work that we have to do is more on education,

35
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,135
and getting people comfortable,

36
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:01,320
and sitting down with prestigious scientists and

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,070
telling them something that's a little out of their comfort zone.

38
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,940
That's most of my challenges.

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,050
Strangely enough,

40
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,285
it's not writing code.

41
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:11,000
It's not solving technical issues in that regard.
