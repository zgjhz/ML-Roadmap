1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,270
So if we have pairs of data,

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,985
and we see that the scatter follows the linear form,

3
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:10,575
then we can summarize these data by the average of the x's,

4
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:12,890
the standard deviation of the x's,

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,815
the average of the y's,

6
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,075
the standard deviations of the y's,

7
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:20,495
and finally the correlation coefficient r,

8
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:25,135
which tells us something about the relationship between x and y.

9
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:28,255
When we plot these pairs, x and y,

10
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:31,400
then we use always the convention that whatever goes on

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,820
the horizontal axis is called the explanatory variable or predictor.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,325
And the one which goes on the vertical axis is called the response variable.

13
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:46,865
It turns out that the correlation coefficient r is always between -1 and 1.

14
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:49,660
The idea is that the sign of r gives

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,700
the direction of the association, whether it slopes up or down,

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,195
and the absolute value of r gives its strength.

17
00:00:57,195 --> 00:00:59,880
Here are a number of examples.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,685
In the leftmost case,

19
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:05,020
we have r equal to -0.9.

20
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,210
Because r is negative,

21
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,760
the whole scatter slopes downward.

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,455
0.9 means that the scatter is tightly clustered around a line.

23
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:18,400
In the second example,

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,675
we have r = -0.6.

25
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:27,150
Again, the scatter is sloping downward, but 0.6 is much closer to 0,

26
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,470
so we see that the scatter is much more spread out.

27
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,080
Finally, if r = 0,

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,975
then there's no perceptible upwards or downwards trend.

29
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:40,365
Now let's go to positive correlation coefficients.

30
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:42,680
If r = 0.2,

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,475
we get an upward scatter,

32
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:46,890
which is rather loose.

33
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,770
Finally, if r = 1,

34
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,340
the scatter slopes upward,

35
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,845
and everything falls perfectly on a line.

36
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:59,235
These examples give you an idea how to think about the correlation coefficient.

37
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:04,465
Keep in mind that the correlation coefficient r comes without units,

38
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:10,080
and that's because both x and y were standardized when we computed r. It also

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,530
turns out that r is not affected by changing the center or the scale of either variable.

40
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,790
For example, if you compute the correlation coefficient between height and weight,

41
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,135
then it doesn't matter whether you measure weight in pounds or in kilograms.

42
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:29,665
It's important to keep in mind, however,

43
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:35,380
that the correlation coefficient is only useful for measuring linear association.

44
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,375
Look at this example here.

45
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:43,050
Clearly, there's a very strong association between the two variables.

46
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,325
You see a tightly clustered scatter around a curve.

47
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:51,480
However, if you compute the correlation coefficient,

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,575
you see r = 0.

49
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:56,490
r = 0 suggests that there's

50
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,855
actually no linear association between these two variables.

51
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:02,900
That's true but, of course,

52
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,330
it misses the point in this case.

53
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:12,040
The bottom line is that r is really only useful when we look at linear scatters.

54
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,300
Finally, it's tempting to see a large correlation coefficient and

55
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,950
conclude that there must be some type of

56
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,445
causal correlationship between the two variables.

57
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:28,070
But the example on the bottom left shows that this is just not true.

58
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,790
That scatter plot shows shoe sizes as

59
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,865
well as the score on a reading test for 100 schoolchildren.

60
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:43,230
Clearly, there is a very strong association between these two variables.

61
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:50,040
But we would agree that shoe size has no causal effect on reading ability whatsoever.

62
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,145
Rather, what's going on here is that there's a third variable,

63
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:56,665
namely the age of the school children,

64
00:03:56,665 --> 00:04:01,115
which determines both the shoe size and the reading ability.

65
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:06,800
So, what's going on here is that correlation does not mean causation,

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,000
and we've talked about that before.
