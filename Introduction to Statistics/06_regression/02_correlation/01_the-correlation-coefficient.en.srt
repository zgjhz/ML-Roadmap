1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,850
Before we can do regression,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,890
we need to know about the correlation coefficient.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,940
Remember that the scatterplot is very useful in

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,310
visualizing the relationship between two quantitative variables.

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,115
For example, in the left scatterplot,

6
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:18,820
which shows education and income,

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,485
we see that there seems to be an upward direction of the scatterplot.

8
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:27,650
That is also true for the scatterplot that

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,645
shows the heights of the fathers and their sons on the right.

10
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:36,175
However, these two relationships are somewhat different.

11
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:40,190
If we look at the relationship of income on education,

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,910
we see that there seems to be kind of an upward sloping curve,

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,130
which the scatter follows.

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,695
On the other hand, if we look at the heights,

15
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:54,490
we see that a scatter roughly follows a line.

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,350
Finally, the last thing we can get out of

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,710
a scatterplot is the strength of the relationship.

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,785
That means, how closely do the points follow the form?

19
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:07,270
In the example of the heights,

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,785
we see the scatter is quite wide around the line,

21
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:13,690
whereas in the example of the incomes,

22
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,615
it's more closely around the curve.

23
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:20,730
In the case where the scatter clusters around a line,

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,240
it's very useful to summarize that clustering with a correlation coefficient

25
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,810
r. It's not worth to remember the formula for r, but let's look at what's going on there.

26
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,320
You see that we are looking at

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,670
the standardized values of the x's, and the standardized values of the y's.

28
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,950
And then we multiply them together and take the average of all the observations.

29
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,280
Now, you see that this product here is

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,440
positive if both x is above x-bar and y is above y-bar,

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,605
and it could also be positive if x is below x-bar and y is also below y-bar.

32
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:04,430
So, this contribution will be positive if

33
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,200
both x and y vary in the same direction from the averages,

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,440
and it will be negative if they vary in opposite directions.

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,935
So the idea of the correlation coefficient is that the correlation coefficient should be

36
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:25,000
positive if the scatter slopes upward, and it's negative if it slopes downward.
