1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,245
Now, let's do a prediction.

2
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:05,385
Regression says that if we are given x,

3
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:08,175
then, we use the regression line to predict y.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,470
That means, we compute the regression line,

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,480
plug in x, and see what predictor y hat we get.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,010
As noted before, in order to compute a regression line,

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,990
all we need to have are the five summary numbers of these statistics.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,340
Computing the regression line can be done very quickly in software.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,905
For example, the command lm in the computer language R will do that for you.

10
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:36,985
But it turns out you can actually do it rather quickly by hand.

11
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:38,645
Let's look at an example.

12
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:42,685
Let's say the average midterm score was 49.5,

13
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:45,755
the average final score was 69.1,

14
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,340
the standard deviation on the midterm was 10.2,

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,955
the standard deviation on the final 11.8,

16
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:54,290
and the correlation coefficient r was 0.67.

17
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,210
Now, suppose somebody tells you a student scored 41 on the midterm,

18
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,540
and you have to predict the final exam score of that student.

19
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,370
Remember, if we wouldn't have that information about the midterm score, then,

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:12,480
the best predictor for the final would simply be the average of 69.1.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,510
But regression gives us a tool to come up with a better predictor by

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:23,105
incorporating the additional information that the student scored 41 on the midterm.

23
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:27,335
Here's how we can do that regression by hand very quickly.

24
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:33,630
First, note that 41 is 8.5 below the average.

25
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,810
Here, average refers to the average of the midterm scores which is 49.5.

26
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,945
Now, we standardize this, 8.5 below average means

27
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:50,569
0.83 standard deviations below average.

28
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,405
Looking at the formula for the slope of the regression line,

29
00:01:54,405 --> 00:02:03,530
we predict the final exam score to be only r times 0.83 standard deviation below average.

30
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,115
So, now, we can simply plug in the numbers.

31
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:14,860
We take the average for the final exam, we

32
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,755
subtract off because we are below average.

33
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:23,840
So, we have to subtract off r which is 0.67 times

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,520
0.83 times the standard deviation for the final exam scores,

35
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,260
which is 11.8, and we arrive at 62.5.

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,315
This will be our prediction that we get from regression.

37
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:45,290
Now, let's turn the prediction around.

38
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,755
Suppose I told you that a student scored 89 on the final,

39
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:54,025
and your task is to predict the midterm score of that student.

40
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:56,575
Here's one important thing about regression.

41
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,575
When you predict x from y,

42
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:03,865
it is a mistake to use the regression line you got from predicting y on x,

43
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:05,835
and simply solve for x.

44
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:09,210
It's somewhat tempting, but it's the wrong thing to do.

45
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,385
The reason why it's wrong is because there are two regression lines.

46
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:16,680
There's one regression line for predicting y on x,

47
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,225
and there's a different regression line for predicting x on y.

48
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:23,655
These two lines will typically be very different.

49
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:27,330
To avoid the confusion between these two lines,

50
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,390
it's always best to predict on the x axis, and whatever you want to protect on the y axis,

51
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,275
and then you simply do what we did before.

52
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,264
So, in this case,

53
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:45,085
that would mean we look at an x axis which corresponds to the final exam score,

54
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:48,980
and a y axis which shows us the midterm scores.

55
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,665
That's because the final exam score is the thing we base our regression on,

56
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:56,650
that is, the final exam score is the predictor.

57
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,455
So, we know the average of the final exam scores was 69.1,

58
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:07,190
the average on the midterms was 49.5,

59
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:12,660
and the information we are given is that the final exam score is 89.

60
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,920
So, it's above average.

61
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,485
We know that the regression line goes through the points

62
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:24,570
that are the average on the horizontal axis and the average on the vertical axis,

63
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,500
and it slopes upward because r is positive.

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,185
So, the regression line looks somewhat like this.

65
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:34,570
Since we base our regression on a final exam score of 89,

66
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,175
we expect to end up somewhere above average for midterm.

67
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:44,420
Exactly, how much above average is this calculation which we just did before?

68
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:52,015
So, we say that 89 is 9.9 above average.

69
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:54,100
So, if we standardize,

70
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:02,500
we get 9.9 divided by the standard deviation of 11.8,

71
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,590
equals 0.84 standard deviations above average.

72
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,755
Therefore, our prediction for the midterm,

73
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:18,315
will be also above average,

74
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:22,430
and it will be not 0.84 standard deviation above

75
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:29,540
average, but r times 0.84 standard deviations above average.

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,820
And now, you can just plug in.

77
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,435
We take the average for the midterms which is 49.5.

78
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,180
Since we are above average,

79
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:50,015
we add r which is 0.67 times 0.84 times the standard deviation which is 10.2,

80
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:54,620
and that gives us 55.2.

81
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,570
This will be our prediction for the midterm score.

82
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,875
Now, keep in mind,

83
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,530
if r were negative, then,

84
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,710
the line would slope downward,

85
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,545
and then, we would end up below average.

86
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:09,649
So, whether we predict above or below average,

87
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:14,105
depends on whether the correlation coefficient is positive or negative,

88
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:20,110
and it also depends on whether we start out above average here or below average there,

89
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,270
and it's best to make a picture and see which side you have to end up.
