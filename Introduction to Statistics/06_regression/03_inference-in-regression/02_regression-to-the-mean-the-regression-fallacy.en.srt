1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Now, the main use of regression is to predict y from x.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,070
And we can simply do that by plugging in x into

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,125
the equation of our regression line which gives us the predicted value y hat.

4
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,560
Now, from the formulas on the previous slide,

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,685
you can see that if we predicted x equal the average of all the x's,

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:25,515
then this prediction will simply produce the average of the y's.

7
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:28,630
But the formula for the slope means,

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,080
that if we take x to be one standard deviation above the average,

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,125
then the predicted y value is

10
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:41,540
only r times one standard deviation above the average of the y's.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,180
Now r is typically smaller than 1 and larger than -1.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,380
And so this means the prediction is towards the mean,

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,455
in a sense that the predicted value y hat is fewer stardard deviations away from its mean,

14
00:00:56,455 --> 00:00:59,670
then x is from the mean of the x's.

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,095
Let's look at the scatter plot that shows scores

16
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:06,880
on midterms and final exams for a number of students.

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,025
The midterm scores are on the horizontal axis,

18
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:13,185
and the final exam scores on the vertical axis.

19
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:18,410
You see that the regression line clearly shows regression towards the mean.

20
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,540
For example, if you look at students who did very well on the midterm,

21
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,770
it would be roughly those very much on the right hand side.

22
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,130
You see that their final exam scores which are given on

23
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,440
the vertical axis are somewhat below the top scores on the final exam.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,405
So, regression towards the mean actually makes sense.

25
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:42,110
We predict that the top scores on the midterm will

26
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,370
score somewhat below the top on the final exam.

27
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,405
Likewise, if you look at the worst scores on the midterm,

28
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:51,750
it would be roughly those,

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,360
but those students did actually not score the worst on the final

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,295
because the worst scores on the finals are below there.

31
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:02,550
Again, we would predict correctly that

32
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,140
the final exam scores should not be as

33
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,265
far away from the average as the midterm scores were.

34
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:14,685
This is called regression to the mean, or the regression effect.

35
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,790
One way to remember that,

36
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,120
is to look at a test-retest situation just as

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,350
the example of where we previously looked at

38
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,640
the midterm and final exam scores of students.

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,410
In such a test-retest situation,

40
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,190
the top group on the test would drop down

41
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,125
somewhat on the retest, and the bottom group moves up.

42
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,605
Why would that be?

43
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:39,275
Here's a very heuristic explanation.

44
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:43,580
To score among the very top on the midterm requires two things.

45
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,565
First of all, the student has to be prepared very well,

46
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:50,110
and there's probably also some luck involved.

47
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,900
For example, the students may be very well

48
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,430
prepared for the questions that happen to be on the midterm.

49
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,740
Another element of luck might be that the student had a very good sleep the night before.

50
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,805
Now when we go to the retest situation like the final exam,

51
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:10,295
then some of the students may not have that luck anymore in their favor.

52
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:15,025
And that's the reason why we expect this group to fall back a little bit.

53
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:18,245
The same thing applies to the bottom group.

54
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:21,570
The worst score is probably due to

55
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,010
some degree to some bad luck and on the retest situation,

56
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,600
there's hope that this bad luck is not there anymore.

57
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,975
It's important to realize that this is simply an effect of the scatter around the line.

58
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:38,715
Sometimes, people look at that effect

59
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:41,805
and conclude that there must be something else going on.

60
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:45,270
For example, the conclusion might be that the top scorers on

61
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,860
the midterm slackened off and did worse on the final.

62
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,000
Such an erroneous conclusion is called the regression fallacy.
