1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,525
So, how does regression work?

2
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:04,080
Let's look at this scatter,

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,235
it shows the age and the percent of body fat for a number of people.

4
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:12,255
This scatter appears roughly linear.

5
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:15,650
So this is a case where we might use regression.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,955
The idea is that we want to summarize this scatter by a line.

7
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:26,975
This line should look something like this one, and the question is how do we get it?

8
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:31,120
Recall that the equation of a line looks like this,

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:38,915
you have an intercept a, plus a slope times the argument x.

10
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:43,600
So, if we plug in the ith x variable,

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,035
then the equation of a line gives us a point which we call yi hat.

12
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:57,310
The idea of finding the line is we want to look at those values of a and b that

13
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:05,670
minimize the difference between the point on the line yi hat, and the true observed value yi.

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,545
One way to do that is to look at the difference between yi and yi hat,

15
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:15,285
square it up, and sum it over all the observations,

16
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:20,720
and then we want to find a and b to minimize that sum.

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,130
Minimizing that sum in a and b can be

18
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,860
done either by calculus or simply using software on the computer.

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,775
The whole idea is called the method of least squares.

20
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,665
It turns out that the solutions

21
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:41,280
involve all the summary quantities that we looked at before.

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,545
The slope equals the correlation coefficient times the ratio of the two standard deviations,

23
00:01:48,545 --> 00:01:54,310
and the intercept involves the means as well as the slope previously derived.

24
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,780
This line is called the regression line.

25
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,075
Now there's another interpretation of the regression line.

26
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:05,435
It computes the average value of y,

27
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:08,455
when the first coordinate is near x.

28
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:15,940
Remember, the idea in statistics is that an average is oftentimes a best predictor.

29
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:22,450
So by computing averages of y values, where the first coordinate is near x,

30
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,910
we finesse that argument somewhat to

31
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,225
incorporate the information given to us in terms of x.

32
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:32,780
And the idea would be that this is a better predictor

33
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,950
of y than simply taking the average of all the y's.
