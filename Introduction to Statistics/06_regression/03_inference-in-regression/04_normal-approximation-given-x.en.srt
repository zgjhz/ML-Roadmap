1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,605
So, remember, in order to do regression,

2
00:00:03,605 --> 00:00:08,785
we must have a scatter plot that looks somewhat football-shaped.

3
00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:11,340
It turns out, in that case,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,395
not only can we compute a regression line,

5
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:16,400
but we can actually also do

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,555
normal approximation and say a little bit more about the y-values.

7
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:23,095
For a given value of X,

8
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:27,995
we can predict by simply by looking at the point that falls onto the line.

9
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:31,190
But it turns out that the y-values of pairs,

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,785
which are near that x-value,

11
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:35,185
actually follow the normal curve.

12
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:39,120
So, there's a normal curve for the y-values around that point.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,005
That means we can use normal approximation for those y-values.

14
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:47,025
Remember, in order to do normal approximation,

15
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:48,855
we need to know two things.

16
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:54,230
We need to know the center and the scale of the normal curve in order to standardize.

17
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,180
In the case of regression,

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,610
these two numbers are given by the predicted value y-hat.

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,030
And the scale is given by the formula

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,515
square root 1 - r squared times the standard deviation of y.

21
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:09,985
Let's do an example.

22
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:13,475
Among the students who scored around 41 on the midterm,

23
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:17,000
what percentage scored above 60 on the final?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,320
We already computed that the predicted value for a student

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,015
who scores 41 on the midterm is 62.5.

26
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:36,615
That means that the normal curve is centered at 62.5.

27
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:41,320
So, the percentage of students who scored above 60 on the final follows

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,535
a normal curve that is centered at 62.5.

29
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:51,880
And we want to figure out what percentage scored above 60.

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,810
So that would be that shaded area.

31
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,580
So, now we simply standardize 60.

32
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,330
We take 60, subtract off 62.5,

33
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,330
and we divide by that formula over here.

34
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,540
So, that's square root 1 - 0.67

35
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:15,130
squared times the standard deviation of the final exam scores,

36
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:20,615
which is 11.8, and we find -0.29.

37
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:23,935
So then, we get a standard normal curve,

38
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:30,805
and we have to figure out the area to the right of -0.29.

39
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:34,135
And if you look up software,

40
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:39,265
you'll find that this area is 61.4%.

41
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:45,725
So, the answer would be that among all the students who scored around 41 on the midterm,

42
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:50,080
about 61% scored above 60 on the final exam.
