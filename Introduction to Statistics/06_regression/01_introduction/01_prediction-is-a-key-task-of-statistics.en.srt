00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
Regression is arguably the most important statistical technique.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,390
It is extremely versatile, and can be used for problems where at first sight,

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,575
one might not have expected that regression is useful.

4
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:15,210
We will discuss the main ideas for inference and

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,090
regression and how to do regression diagnostics.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,764
We will also look at some pitfalls.

7
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:27,165
The histogram on the top left shows the heights of 928 sons.

8
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:31,570
The average of the heights is 68.1 inches.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:37,050
Now suppose we pick one of these sons at random and the task is to predict his height.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,335
In fact, what one typically finds in statistics

11
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:45,910
is taking the average is in some sense the best predictor.

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,135
Now suppose we have more information.

13
00:00:49,135 --> 00:00:53,790
Not only do we have a histogram of the heights for the sons,

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,185
but we also know the heights of their fathers.

15
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:05,380
The heights of these 928 father-son pairs are given in the scatter plot on the left.

16
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,320
Again we have to predict the height of a son,

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,005
but now suppose we know that the father is 72 inches tall.

18
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:18,690
Clearly this additional information should help us somehow in our prediction.

19
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:24,500
The reason for this is that if we know that the father is 72 inches tall,

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,640
then we know that they are somewhere among this group of fathers and sons.

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,350
And we know that for this group the heights of the sons are on the higher end.

22
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,580
What this means is that the additional information of knowing

23
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,480
the father's height should allow us to come up with a better predictor.

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,950
And that is precisely what a regression does for us.
