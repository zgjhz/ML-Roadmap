00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,762
Remember that a good experiment requires
that the subjects are assigned to

2
00:00:04,762 --> 00:00:07,220
treatment of control by a random process.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,000
The idea is that any confounders
operate equally on both groups.

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,120
Of course, since we are using
a random assignment, there's a chance

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,730
that one confounder is more prevalent
in one group than the other.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,320
But here's the second key point.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,140
Because we use a random assignment, we
can actually calculate the size of these

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,150
chance effects when we evaluate
the outcome of the experiment.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,700
We will see later how to do that.
