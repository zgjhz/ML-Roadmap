1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,915
You may have read in the news that people who eat red meat

2
00:00:03,915 --> 00:00:08,725
have higher rates of certain cancers than people who don't eat red meat.

3
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:12,270
The statistical term for this is that

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,640
there's an association between red meat consumption and

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,080
cancer but it's important to keep in mind

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,350
that this does not mean that eating red meat causes cancer.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,380
This is because people who don't eat red meat are known to exercise more and drink

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,450
less alcohol, and it could be

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,980
the latter two issues that caused the difference in cancer rates.

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,730
What we have here is called an observational study.

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,990
It simply measures the outcomes of interest.

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,580
In this case, it would measure the cancer rate among

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,595
people who eat red meat and the cancer rate among people who do not eat red meat.

14
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:52,125
Based on these measurements,

15
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:56,890
one can say whether there's an association between these two factors.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,565
But as we saw before,

17
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:04,650
association does not mean causation because there may be other factors.

18
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,025
These are called confounding factors.

19
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,635
Sometimes they have the name lurking variable.

20
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:17,320
Now, what we really would like to know is whether eating red meat actually causes cancer.

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,335
For that, we need an experiment.

22
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:23,520
In an experiment, a treatment is actually

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,210
assigned to people in one group but not in the other group.

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,365
Treatment is a technical term.

25
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:36,230
For example, if we have a new medication against high blood pressure,

26
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,600
then the treatment would be to take this medication.

27
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,070
The group that gets the treatment is called

28
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,790
a treatment group, and the other group is called the control group.

29
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,050
After we assign the treatment,

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,260
we compare the outcomes in the two groups.

31
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,330
We have already seen that confounders can be a problem.

32
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,520
For that reason, the two groups should be similar.

33
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,375
Of course, the treatment is different in the two groups.

34
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,940
The best way to make sure that the two groups are similar is

35
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,895
to assign the persons into the two groups at random.

36
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:17,159
The way to think about the random assignment

37
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,010
is that for each subject we toss a coin and if

38
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,350
it comes up heads then the subject goes into

39
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,345
the treatment group and if it comes up tails it will go in the control group.

40
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:31,780
Another precaution we should take is

41
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,860
that every subject in the control group gets a placebo.

42
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,435
A placebo is very similar to the treatment but it doesn't do anything.

43
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:47,275
In the example where we want to test a new medication against high blood pressure,

44
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:51,050
the treatment might consist of a pill then the placebo

45
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,630
would also be a pill which doesn't have any medication in it.

46
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,195
Why would we do that?

47
00:02:56,195 --> 00:03:03,760
It turns out that the idea of being treated may already have an effect by itself.

48
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,460
This is called the placebo effect.

49
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,330
Assigning a placebo to the control group makes sure

50
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,195
that both groups are equally affected by this placebo effect.

51
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:22,065
The third precaution is that the experiment should be double-blind.

52
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:26,060
That means that neither the subject nor the evaluators know

53
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,390
which subjects are assigned to the treatment, and which are assigned to control.

54
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,985
This is done to avoid biases.

55
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:38,120
For example, if a doctor has to evaluate whether their medication helped,

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,990
then the doctor might be inclined to give

57
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,720
a positive assessment if the doctor knows that the patient has received the treatment.

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,440
Let's briefly go back to the placebo effect.

59
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,925
It sounds a bit mysterious.

60
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:57,385
Indeed, the placebo effect is still not fully understood.

61
00:03:57,385 --> 00:04:00,810
It's somewhere on the boundary between biology and

62
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,855
psychology, and it's probably one of the most interesting phenomena in science.

63
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:09,585
