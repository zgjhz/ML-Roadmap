1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,705
So, through my startups,

2
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:04,085
I had been working with with Paul Lee.

3
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:06,840
Paul was the former President of Electronic Arts.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,160
He ran the show there for about 20 years before he started his own venture capital firm.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,760
He invested in some of my prior startups and I was

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,910
working for him doing diligence at some other companies.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,340
And so anyway, we were out to lunch,

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,780
and he sort of asked me, "Andrew, what the heck are you doing?

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,990
You've done all these startups and now you've gone back to school, help me understand."

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,180
And I told him about this project,

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,010
and I said, "I've been working on this really cool thing.

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,940
I'm using data science to find potential new drug treatments.

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,130
I got one of the best grades in the class on that project.

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,750
I'm really excited, I'm going to publish a paper on this, an academic paper."

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,110
And Paul has got this look,

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,100
when you do something really stupid, it's like, his face does this thing.

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,070
And he started to make that face and I was a little

18
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,130
baffled, right? I just told him how I'm living my dream,

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,565
I'm doing this thing that I'm so passionate about.

20
00:00:57,565 --> 00:00:59,030
And he says to me, 

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,920
"Andrew, you just told me this story about how you want to change the world.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,530
Do you think you'll do that by writing a paper,

23
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,900
or you think you'll do that by filing a patent,

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,790
starting a company, and bringing this technology into the world?"

25
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,075
And so that conversation is just like a worm that dug into my brain,

26
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:20,620
and I kind of couldn't get away from it because he was right.

27
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,660
It was more than just doing something to be

28
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,160
impressive, and rather wanted to actually bring this technology to the world,

29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,090
and do something meaningful with it.

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,660
And that was the beginning of the transition from

31
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,000
the academic world and to creating a new startup around that technology.
