1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,970
One thing to keep in mind is that since the sample is drawn at random,

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,905
the estimate will be somewhat off from the two-population parameter.

3
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:12,640
This is called chance error.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,290
Also, keep in mind that if we draw another sample,

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,675
we will get a somewhat different chance error.

6
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:23,820
So we can think of the estimate as being made up out of three parts.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,405
It should be somewhere close to the parameter.

8
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:31,510
There may be a bias if our sampling is not done well.

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:35,020
And finally, there's a chance error which is unavoidable.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,845
So while the chance error is unavoidable,

11
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:42,870
it turns out, we can make it small by taking a bigger sample size.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,550
Moreover, we can compute how large the chance error will be.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,720
So, it's totally in our control to choose the sample size

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,120
large enough such that the chance error is sufficiently small.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,200
And we will see later how to do that.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,650
Things are quite different for the bias which is also called systematic error.

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,785
If we increase the sample size,

18
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:09,810
the bias will not get smaller.

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,745
Rather, it would just repeat the error on a larger scale.

20
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:17,985
Also, we typically don't know how large the bias is.

21
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:20,940
So, having a bias is a real problem,

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:27,000
and that's the reason why we use chance in sampling in order to avoid a bias.
