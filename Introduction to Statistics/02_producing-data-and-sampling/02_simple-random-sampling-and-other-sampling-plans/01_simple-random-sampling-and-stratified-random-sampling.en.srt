1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,990
Now let's have a look how exactly we would
sample these 1,000 voters at random.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,675
A simple way would be to select
1,000 voters from your neighborhood,

3
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:17,960
say your hometown, this is called
the sample of convenience and

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,400
it's not a good way to sample.

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:25,840
The reason is that the voters of your
hometown will likely be different

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,780
from the population of US voters.

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,080
For example, voters on the West Coast and
on the East Coast tend to be

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,000
more Democratic voters, whereas voters in
the Midwest tend to vote more Republican.

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,720
This will introduce what's called a bias,

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,510
that means the sampling will
favor a certain outcome.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,860
There are various kinds of biases.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,100
Let's look at the three
most important ones.

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,540
We already looked at selection bias.

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,500
For example,
a sample of convenience makes it more

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,165
likely to sample certain
subjects than others.

16
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:06,300
Non-response bias means that
the people who choose to respond

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,170
to the question may be different
from the non-responders.

18
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,033
For example, parents are less likely to
answer a survey request at 6 pm because

19
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,513
they are busy with children and dinner.

20
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:26,480
Finally, you've probably seen websites
that allow you to rate businesses.

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:32,425
The reviews you see there are not
very representative because those

22
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:37,041
reviews are more likely to come
from customers who had very bad or

23
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:42,516
very good experiences and therefore
feel strongly about writing a review.

24
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:45,624
This is called a voluntary response bias.

25
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:52,948
The best way to avoid
such biases is to use

26
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:57,673
chance in some planned
way in the sampling.

27
00:01:57,673 --> 00:02:02,670
The most well-known way of sampling
is called a simple random sample.

28
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,300
It means that subjects are selected
at random without replacement.

29
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,420
So if you sample 1,000 voters
out of the yes population,

30
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,020
that means each sample of size 1,000
is equally likely to be selected.

31
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,880
How would one choose
a simple random sample?

32
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,272
A popular way to do that is
using random digit dialing,

33
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:32,730
that means the computer will dial
telephone numbers at random.

34
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,960
That worked pretty when every
household had a landline.

35
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:44,150
It's more complicated now with many
people using cell phones instead, and

36
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,530
the polling companies are figuring
out ways to get around that.

37
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,280
A more sophisticated way to sample
is stratified random sampling.

38
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,820
There, the population is divided into
groups of similar objects called strata.

39
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,790
For example, the yes voters would be
divided in urban voters, suburban voters,

40
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,640
and rural voters.

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,790
Then a simple random sample is chosen in
each stratum and the results are combined.

42
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:18,290
This sampling can result in a more precise
estimate than with simple random sampling.

43
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,570
However, it's more complicated to execute.
