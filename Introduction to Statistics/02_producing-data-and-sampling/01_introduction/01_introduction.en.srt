1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,125
In this module, we will examine how data are produced.

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:08,970
We will look at the main concepts for drawing samples, and designing experiments.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,640
We will see when it is possible to attribute and

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,045
observe the effect of treatment, such as a medical treatment,

5
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:16,775
and when that's not possible.

6
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:19,725
We will also look at some curious pitfalls.

7
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:22,825
To explain what statistical inference is,

8
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:26,850
let's look at a question you've probably heard a lot about in the news.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:33,205
What percentage of voters approve of the way the U.S. President is handling his job?

10
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:39,735
This question has been asked by polling companies since the 1930s.

11
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:41,605
If you think about it,

12
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:44,250
it's actually quite difficult to answer that question

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,365
because you would have to ask each voter,

14
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:51,900
and there are more than 250 million people of voting age in the US.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,175
It's a daunting task to ask all of these 250 million people.

16
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:59,820
So this would seem to be an impossible question to answer.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,860
However, it's actually not that difficult to estimate that percentage.

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,030
What a polling company does is,

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,915
it samples, say, 1,000 voters at random.

20
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:17,150
Then it uses the approval percentage among those voters,

21
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,205
as an estimate for the approval percentage of all voters.

22
00:01:21,205 --> 00:01:26,345
So there are a few technical terms which we are going to use in the future.

23
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:30,700
The population simply means the entire group of subjects,

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,440
about which we want information.

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,195
In the previous example,

26
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:37,145
this would be all U.S. voters.

27
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:43,085
The parameter is the quantity about the population which we are interested in.

28
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:45,500
In the previous example,

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,380
that would be the approval percentage among all U.S. voters.

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,940
The sample is the part of the population from which we collect information.

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:58,620
That would be the 1,000 voters which were selected at random.

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,910
Finally, a statistic, or an estimate is

33
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,000
the quantity we're interested in as it was measured in the sample.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,045
So that would be the approval percentage among the sample voters only.

35
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,855
An important point is,

36
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:20,145
that even a relatively small sample of 100 or 1,000 voters

37
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:24,575
will produce an estimate that is quite close to the parameter

38
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:30,590
even if the population is very large like the 250 million subjects in that case.

39
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,570
We will see later why that's the case.

40
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:42,110
This example shows why statistics can be such a powerful and useful tool.
