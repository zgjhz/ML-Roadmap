1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,275
So let's do an example to apply these rules.

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:05,570
Let's roll a die three times.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,605
And we want to compute the probability that we get at least one six in the three rolls.

4
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:13,975
So, how would we do that?

5
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:21,270
So, one idea is to write the event at least one six as follows.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,140
It could mean one six on the first roll, or

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,680
one six on the second roll, or one six on the third roll.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,590
So, now we have or in between there.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,965
So that suggests we should try the addition rule.

10
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:44,510
But there's a problem here, because those three events are not mutually exclusive,

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,710
because if we get a six on the first roll,

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,090
we can also get a six on a second roll.

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,650
So we cannot use the addition rule,

14
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,470
and we have to try a different approach.

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,285
So let's try the complement rule.

16
00:00:57,285 --> 00:01:00,120
The probability of having at least one six in

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,380
three rolls is one minus the probability of its complement,

18
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,635
which is no six in three rolls.

19
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,325
So, why am I doing this?

20
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:15,840
No six in three rolls means no six in

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,905
the first roll, and no six in the second roll, and no six in the third roll.

22
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:25,390
So, now you see there's an and between the events,

23
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,965
and that's just what I need, because I know the three rolls are independent.

24
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,700
So I would like to use the multiplication rule.

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,660
And for the multiplication rule,

26
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,455
I have to use ands.

27
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:40,545
So, by using the complement rule first,

28
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:45,255
I put the whole thing in a position where I can use the multiplication rule.

29
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:51,030
So I can simply multiply those events and then I can just

30
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,065
plug in, because the probability of no six in the first roll is simply five six.

31
00:01:57,065 --> 00:02:00,135
And by the way, that's another application of the complement rule.

32
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:04,775
So I get one minus five six, times five six, times five six.

33
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,570
And if you plug it in your calculator,

34
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,760
you'll see this is 41.4%.
