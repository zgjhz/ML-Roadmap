1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,715
Probabilities are always between 0 and 1.

2
00:00:04,715 --> 00:00:11,695
The key for computing probabilities is to apply a few rules repeatedly.

3
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:18,560
We already saw that the probability that a newborn is a girl is 48.8% so,

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,020
what's the probability that a newborn is a boy?

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,480
Well, that's the opposite so,

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,410
it's 1 - 48.8%,

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,970
which is 51.2%.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,375
And that's already our first rule.

9
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,775
To write down rules,

10
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:38,250
it's convenient to abbreviate events such as,

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,620
newborn is a girl with capital letters, such as A.

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,880
So our first rule which is called the complement rule,

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,445
says that the probability that A does not occur is 1 minus the probability of A.

14
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:53,830
This is called the complement rule

15
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:58,365
because A does not occur is also called the complement of A.

16
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:02,365
Now let's look at a different chance experiment, namely, rolling a die.

17
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:07,085
A die has six sides and each of them is equally likely.

18
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:11,895
So each side has probability 1/6 of coming up.

19
00:01:11,895 --> 00:01:13,925
This is our second rule.

20
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:16,970
It's called the rule for equally likely outcomes.

21
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,155
If there are N possible outcomes and they are equally likely,

22
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:26,390
then the probability of an event A is the number of outcomes in A,

23
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,450
divided by N. In the next two rules,

24
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,110
we learn how to compute probabilities of

25
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,115
multiple events as those of the individual events.

26
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:38,750
For the first one,

27
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,280
we need a small definition.

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,175
A and B are called mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time.

29
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:48,585
Let's look at an example.

30
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:51,090
Suppose we roll a die twice.

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,525
Let's call the event A,

32
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:57,570
to be the event where we see one spot on the first roll,

33
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,495
B is the event where we see six spots on the first roll,

34
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:05,555
and C is the event where we see one spot on the second roll.

35
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:08,220
Then A and B are mutually exclusive,

36
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,560
because if we have one spot on the first roll,

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,765
then we cannot have six spots on the first roll.

38
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:19,510
But A and C are not mutually exclusive because if you have one spot on the first roll,

39
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,985
then we can also have one spot on the second roll.

40
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:24,510
So here is our third rule,

41
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,090
it's called the addition rule.

42
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,620
If the events A and B are mutually exclusive,

43
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,690
then the probability of A or B happening is

44
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,670
simply the sum of the probabilities of A and B.

45
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,880
Our last rule involves two events being independent.

46
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,860
That means that knowing that one occurs does

47
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,345
not change the probability that the other occurs. In the above example,

48
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:56,150
B and C are independent, because B concerns the first roll,

49
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,720
and C concerns the second roll, and the outcome of the second roll

50
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,805
doesn't depend on the outcome of the first roll. But the events A and B are not independent,

51
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:10,270
because if you have a 1 on the first roll, then we cannot have a 6 

52
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,410
on the first roll. So the outcome of A

53
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,990
will affect the outcome of B.

54
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,475
So the last rule is the multiplication rule.

55
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:23,300
It says if A and B are independent,

56
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,505
then the probability of A and B happening is simply

57
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:32,650
the product of the probability of A and B.

58
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,965
So if we look at these two rules, we see

59
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,840
that the addition rule has an or,

60
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,420
and the multiplication rule has an and.

61
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,785
And then in the addition rule, 

62
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:50,325
we add, whereas in the multiplication rule, we multiply.

63
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:54,220
And likewise, the assumptions are different. For the addition rule,

64
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,455
the events have to be mutually exclusive, and in the multiplication rule,

65
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:00,580
they have to be independent.

66
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,745
This is what one has to keep in mind to keep these two rules apart.
