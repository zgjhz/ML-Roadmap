1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,090
So here's a survey question
that's quite tricky.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,322
What percentage of students have
cheated during an exam in college?

3
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:15,050
The problem here is that you cannot simply
ask students whether they have cheated.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,750
Students may simply be too embarrassed to
answer truthfully, so what can be done?

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,860
This is being addressed with
what's called randomization.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,030
It works as follows.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,310
We do a survey that first instructs
students to toss a coin twice.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,170
If the student gets
tails on the first toss,

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,010
then the student has to answer question 1.

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,090
Otherwise, the student
has to answer question 2.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,440
Here are the two questions.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,850
Question 1 says, have you ever
cheated on an exam in college?

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,980
Question 2 is,
did you get tails on the second toss?

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,040
So why are we doing this?

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,580
The answer we are going to
get will be partly random.

16
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,545
A yes answer could be due to
the student answering question 1 and

17
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:09,870
having cheated on an exam,
or it could be due to

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,080
the student answering question 2 in
getting tails on the second toss.

19
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,540
So a yes answer doesn't
really tell us anything, and

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,660
this should put the student
at ease to answer truthfully.

21
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:28,760
So if a yes answer doesn't tell us
anything, then why does that work at all?

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,490
So here's the key point.

23
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,630
We cannot really tell what an individual
yes means, but by looking at all

24
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,220
the answers collectively, we can actually
estimate the proportion of cheaters.

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,180
Here's how it works.

26
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:49,500
A yes answer can come from
either question 1 or question 2.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,140
So we can divide up the event
of a yes into two parts.

28
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,090
This is the same reasoning that we've
used before with the spam filter.

29
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,590
So the probability of a yes answer could
be a probability of a yes answer and

30
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,220
question 1 was answered, plus
the probability of a yes answer and

31
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,710
question 2 was answered.

32
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,570
And now I simply plug in the formulas for

33
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,440
conditional probabilities,
and I get this.

34
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,870
What we are interested
in is this probability.

35
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,430
A yes answer on question 1,
which is the question about cheating.

36
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,730
So what we do is we solve for this
probability, and we get this expression.

37
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,590
So let's see, we know the probability
that question 2 was asked.

38
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,310
That's just a half, because it
depended on the first coin toss.

39
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,290
The probability that question
1 was asked is also half.

40
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,880
And the probability of a yes answer
given question 2 was asked, that's also

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,580
half because question 2 simply asks
whether you got tails on the second toss.

42
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,980
So the only thing which we don't know is
the probability that the answer will be 

43
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,550
yes.

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,100
But this we can estimate from data.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,980
In one survey, 27 students answered yes and
30 answered no.

46
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:30,842
So we can estimate the probability of
a yes answer as 27 over 57, which is 47%.

47
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:38,672
Now we plug in and we find that
the probability of a yes answer,

48
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:44,405
given question 1 was answered, is 44%.

49
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:49,358
So we can estimate that about
44% of all students have cheated

50
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:51,110
on an exam in college.
