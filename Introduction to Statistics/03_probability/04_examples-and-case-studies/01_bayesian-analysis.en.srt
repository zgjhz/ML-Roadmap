00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,730
The previous example where we computed probabilities in order to classify

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:12,810
email as spam is a simple example of what's called a Bayesian analysis.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,925
The idea is as follows. Before looking at the email,

4
00:00:16,925 --> 00:00:22,225
we already know that about 20% of all email is spam.

5
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:29,275
So there's already a prior probability of 20% that the email is spam.

6
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:32,700
The idea now is to look at

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,105
the evidence inside the email, such as certain key words like money,

8
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:44,130
and to improve on that prior probability using that evidence we find inside the email.

9
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,780
So we did this using the Bayesian formula.

10
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:57,285
And the way to think about this is that the Bayes' rule allows us to improve or update

11
00:00:57,285 --> 00:01:01,670
the prior probability into what's called a posterior

12
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:07,710
probability that incorporates the information that we found inside the email.

13
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,115
Here's another example where we will use Bayes' rule.

14
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:16,590
Suppose that 1% of the population has a certain disease,

15
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,380
and there's a test,

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,585
that tests for the presence of the disease.

17
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:23,930
If an infected person is tested,

18
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,805
then there's a 95% chance that the test is positive,

19
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:30,130
but if the person is not infected,

20
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,485
then there's still a 2% chance that a test gives an erroneous positive result.

21
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:40,000
That's called a false positive, because it's a positive result when in fact,

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,790
the person is not infected.

23
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,565
Given that a person tests positive,

24
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:48,695
what are now the chances that he has the disease?

25
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:52,735
So, let's look what probabilities we have.

26
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:56,500
First, there's the 1%, that refers

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,850
to the probability that a certain person has the disease.

28
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:07,875
So we can write this down as the probability that the disease is present as 1%.

29
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:16,100
Then we have the 95% chance that a test is positive if the person is infected.

30
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,790
That's a condition of probability,

31
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,870
the probability of a positive test given that the disease is present.

32
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,715
Finally, there's the 2%.

33
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,770
That refers to the probability of

34
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,835
a positive outcome given that the disease is not present.

35
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:37,420
What do we want to know?

36
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,540
Well, we want to know the probability that

37
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,615
a disease is present given that the test is positive.

38
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:51,280
So now, you see we are looking for a conditional probability when what we

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,880
have is a conditional probability with

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,380
the roles of positive outcome and disease flipped around.

41
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,240
So, that immediately tells you that you want to use Bayes' rule,

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,765
because Bayes' rule allows you to flip these two things around.

43
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:10,105
When you plug in, this is what you get.

44
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:15,425
So let's see whether we can get an answer from there right away.

45
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:19,950
We know the probability of a positive test given that the disease

46
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,510
is present and we know the probability of the disease being present,

47
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,085
but we do not know the probability of a positive test.

48
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:35,180
So this is the case where we want to use the expanded version of Bayes' rule.

49
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,915
Now, we can simply plug in,

50
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:40,365
everything that's written there we know.

51
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:44,100
For example, the probability of not having

52
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,170
a disease is simply 99% by the complement rule.

53
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,110
If you plug in, what you get is 32.4%.

54
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,080
This is surprisingly low.

55
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,420
After all, there is a positive test.

56
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:07,105
The test seems to be quite good, 95% of the time when the disease is present,

57
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:12,915
the test finds it, and only 2% of the time, when the disease is not present, will the test

58
00:04:12,915 --> 00:04:16,950
give an erroneous result.

59
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,620
So how come then there's only a 32% chance

60
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,140
that the disease is there, if we have a positive test?

61
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,195
The reason is, that most of the population

62
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:29,210
does not have the disease.

63
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,145
Only 1% of the population has the disease, and the test finds most of those.

64
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:40,170
But there's also a 2% chance of finding the disease for a non-infected person.

65
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,570
And since there are so many people who

66
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,080
are not infected, that number is

67
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,605
quite big, and that's why there's only a 32% chance the

68
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:53,990
disease is present among those tested positive.
