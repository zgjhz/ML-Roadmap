1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,910
So, these type of computations are actually used for spam filters.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,160
We already saw that the probability that the word money appears in an e-mail,

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,555
given that the e-mail is spam, is 8%.

4
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:16,900
But for a spam filter,

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,000
we need to know a different conditional probability.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,595
We need to know the probability that the e-mail is spam,

7
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:26,545
given that money appears in the email.

8
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:30,925
Because after all, we want to classify an e-mail as spam,

9
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:34,675
if we think there's a high probability that it is spam.

10
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:39,040
So, we need that conditional probability, rather than the first one.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,680
The formula for conditional probabilities says that,

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,895
"the probability of B given A,

13
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:49,965
is the probability of A and B, divided by the probability of A."

14
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:53,305
But A and B is the same as B and A.

15
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:57,875
So, I can simply switch the roles of A and B in the numerator,

16
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:03,060
and write probability of B and A, and then I can use

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,575
the same formula for conditional probability, with the roles of A and B reversed.

18
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:11,330
And what I get is this,

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,510
probability of A given B,

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,650
times probability of B divided by probability of A.

21
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,250
So, what this simple calculation does for us is,

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,020
it computes a probability of B given A,

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,795
in terms of a probability of A given B.

24
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:35,590
And that's exactly what we need for the above problem.

25
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,870
We want to know, the probability that e-mail is spam,

26
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,690
given that the word money appears in the email.

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,030
And applying that formula says that,

28
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,555
this equals the probability that the word money appears in the email,

29
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:51,360
given that the email is spam,

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,205
times the probability that the email is spam,

31
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:57,885
over the probability that money appears in the e-mail.

32
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:05,570
And we know all of these probabilities, and can plug in, and we find 67%.

33
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,450
So, this rule has a special name.

34
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,140
It's called, Bayes' rule.

35
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,140
This is the formula we derived above,

36
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,310
and sometimes it turns out that

37
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:26,330
the denominator probability of A is not directly given to us, and we have to compute it.

38
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:32,985
And we do that just as we computed the probability of money on the previous slide.

39
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,685
And if we do that,

40
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:39,265
we get the expanded version of Bayes' formula which looks like that.

41
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:42,490
So, the key to applying Bayes' rule is,

42
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,765
to always first try the simpler version,

43
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,500
and then if it turns out that we don't know the denominator,

44
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,395
then we try the more complicated version.

45
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:56,775
The key for Bayes' rule is it turns

46
00:02:56,775 --> 00:03:04,140
conditional probabilities of A given B into probabilities of B given A.
