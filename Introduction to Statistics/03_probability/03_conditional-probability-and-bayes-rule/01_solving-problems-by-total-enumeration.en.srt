00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,230
To explain conditional probability,

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,420
let's look at spam e-mail.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:12,910
Spam e-mail contains certain words with a higher frequency than non-spam e-mail,

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,695
which is also called ham e-mail.

5
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:16,675
For example, the word money,

6
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:21,805
and that's because one reason people send spam e-mail is to get your money.

7
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:28,750
The probability that the word money appears in spam e-mail is 8%.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,565
And the way we write this is probability of money appears in e-mail.

9
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:38,780
Given, which is denoted by a vertical line.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,710
Given that the e-mail is spam, is 8%.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,155
And the probability that money appears in an e-mail,

12
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:50,550
given that the e-mail is ham is only 1%.

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,315
The conditional probability of B given A is now defined as

14
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:59,825
the probability of B given A is the probability of

15
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:03,920
A and B divided by the probability of A.

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,260
And rearranging that already gives us what's called the general multiplication rule.

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:18,835
The probability of A and B is the probability of A times the probability of B given A.

18
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:22,800
So, remember the multiplication rule we had earlier.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,595
In the special case,

20
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:27,344
where the events A and B are independent,

21
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:34,665
the probability of A and B is simply the probability of A times the probability of B.

22
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:38,920
So, you see in the special case of independence,

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,340
the conditional probability of B given A is the same as the probability of B,

24
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,890
and that makes sense because independence

25
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,815
means that the outcome of B does not depend on A.

26
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:55,095
So, let's do some computations.

27
00:01:55,095 --> 00:02:01,010
It's known that the probability that any e-mail is spam is about 20%.

28
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:07,600
Let's compute the probability that a randomly chosen e-mail has the word money in it.

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,890
How would we do that?

30
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,885
So, remember what we know so far.

31
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:15,480
We know that the probability that money

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,655
appears given the e-mail is spam is 8%,

33
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:23,950
and the probability that money appears given that the e-mail is ham is only 1%.

34
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,310
But, I want to know the probability of money and I

35
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,095
only have the conditional probability of money given spam and ham.

36
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:36,195
So, the key idea here is,

37
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:41,595
to artificially introduce that event whether we have spam or ham.

38
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,890
The way this is done is,

39
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,525
we can write the event that money appears in the e-mail as two events.

40
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:53,135
The event that money appears in the e-mail is spam

41
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:57,015
or the event that money appears in the e-mail is ham.

42
00:02:57,015 --> 00:03:03,060
And now you see these two events are mutually exclusive because if the e-mail is spam,

43
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,685
it cannot be ham.

44
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:08,235
And since there's an or in between these two,

45
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:10,955
we can use the addition rule.

46
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:16,990
The probability that money appears in the e-mail is the probability that money

47
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,780
appears in the e-mail is spam and

48
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,530
the probability that money appears in the e-mail is ham.

49
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,630
And now, I simply plug in the definition of conditional probability.

50
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,520
The first term is the probability that the word money appears

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,025
given the e-mail is spam times the probability that the e-mail is spam,

52
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:41,305
and likewise, for the second term.

53
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,155
And all of these things,

54
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:49,240
I know and can simply plug in, and I get 2.4%.
