00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
In this module, we will discuss the basic rules of

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,735
probability that we will need for our statistical methodology later on.

3
00:00:08,735 --> 00:00:12,420
It turns out that there are only a few rules that are essential.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,300
Even quite difficult problems in probability can be

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,855
solved by applying these few rules in the right places.

6
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:22,110
We will also look at some case studies that show

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,205
how these simple rules can be used in surprising ways.

8
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:28,540
For example, to build a spam filter for email.

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,065
So, what does it mean to talk about probability?

10
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:35,030
Let's look at a data example.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,020
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, in 2015,

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,810
there were about 4 million babies born in the US

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,540
and 48.8% of these newborns were girls.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,550
So then, if we look at a baby that's born someday in 2015 and we ask ourselves,

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,265
what are the chances that this baby is a girl, we would say, "Well,

16
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:02,125
the probability of a baby being a girl is 48.8%."

17
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:07,385
And we write this with a capital P for probability and then,

18
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:10,375
in brackets, we write down the event we're interested in.

19
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:16,715
In this case, the newborn is a girl and this equals 48.8%.

20
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:22,085
So this example shows how the probability of an event is defined.

21
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:28,275
It's defined as the proportion of times that this event occurs in many repetitions.

22
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:31,320
So, this definition requires that we look at

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,115
a chance experiment that can be repeated many, many times.

24
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:39,595
For example, if we toss a fair coin,

25
00:01:39,595 --> 00:01:43,440
we say the chances of getting heads is 50%,

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,210
and the chances of getting tails is also 50%,

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,645
and that's something that can actually be checked.

28
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:52,355
And believe it or not, some people did check it.

29
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:54,205
In World War II,

30
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:57,680
the South African mathematician, John Kerrich,

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,310
tossed a coin 10,000 times and found that 5,067 tosses resulted in heads.

32
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,355
So, that's roughly 50% of the tosses.

33
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:13,600
This definition of probability as

34
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,660
a long-run interpretation of frequencies can make it

35
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,815
difficult to interpret probabilities for a single event.

36
00:02:19,815 --> 00:02:23,955
For example, the journalist David Leonhardt of the New York Times,

37
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:27,345
writes about this problem in his article,

38
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:29,435
"What I was wrong about this year".

39
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:33,545
Sometimes people use a different interpretation of probability.

40
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:36,600
For example, if somebody says,

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,140
"The probability that my best friend calls today is 30%," then this statement

42
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,469
clearly cannot be interpreted as a long-run frequency because today,

43
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:51,620
the particular circumstances of today happened only once.

44
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,010
So, what this person means is there's

45
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,460
simply a subjective feeling of 30% that this event will happen.

46
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,610
So, this is called a subjective probability.

47
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,645
It's not based on experiments,

48
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:10,150
and different people may assign different probabilities to the same event.
