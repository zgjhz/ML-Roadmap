1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
So, I think a lot of the work we're doing is pretty unique in

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,940
this field in that, so we're certainly

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,180
not the only folks using data science in drug discovery.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,750
But I would characterize a lot of these other efforts as going after either one type of

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,895
data generation, and sort of examining that data to see if there's some new insight there.

6
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:27,415
Or it's some sort of clever methodology to examine data that already exists.

7
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:30,540
And kind of that approach reminds me

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,610
a bit about the children's story of the blind men and the elephant, right?

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,080
When you're only inspecting sort of a small piece

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,975
of the entire universe that represents a drug or a disease,

11
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:44,070
you might look at that elephant as that blind man and

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,125
say it's a rope, or a spear, rather than seeing the entire picture.

13
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,210
And our view is, it would be much more interesting to

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,735
pull in the widest diversity of data you can get your hands on.

15
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:58,220
And then across that sort of spectrum of information,

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,350
help figure out, what's a false positive?

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,000
What's actually meaningful?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,440
Help correlate a signal you see across

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,400
these very different datasets, and use that to help focus

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,880
in on what's the most likely drug treatment that's going to work for

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,875
that disease, and for those populations.

22
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:18,840
For us, we'd probably fall more in the category of translational bioinformatics,

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,380
which is saying we want to actually take data and

24
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,915
translate that into some medical intervention in some way.

25
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:28,070
And so yeah, there's different disciplines.

26
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,860
There's people who are just interested in raw knowledge and not

27
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,560
necessarily trying to produce a diagnostic, or a drug, sorts of things.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,380
So there's lots of different ways that technologies in this field can be applied.
