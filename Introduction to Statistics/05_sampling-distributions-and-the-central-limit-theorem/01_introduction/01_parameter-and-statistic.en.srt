1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
The main topics in this module are

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,520
the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,150
The name central limit theorem comes from the central place

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,840
that this theorem has in statistics. So it's important.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,190
But it's also important to understand that in every statistical analysis,

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,725
there are several histograms floating around.

7
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:23,060
The probability histogram which generates the data,

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,445
the histogram of the observed data, and the probability histogram of an estimator.

9
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,920
It's important to understand these, and to keep them apart,

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,565
and that's another goal of this module.

11
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:39,905
So, let's have another look at the distinction between a parameter and a statistic.

12
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:44,090
What's the average height of adult men in the United States?

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,760
That's quite difficult to get a handle on, because there are 120 million adult men.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,390
But it turns out that one can estimate

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,250
this number quite well with a relatively small sample.

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,230
In this section, we'll see why that is.

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:05,195
Remember that the population in this case is all adult men in the US,

18
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:07,700
and there are about 120 million of them.

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,855
A parameter is something about the population we are interested in.

20
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:15,005
For example, the population average which we call

21
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:19,845
mu or the population standard deviation which we call sigma.

22
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:26,175
A statistic or an estimate is this quantity as it's measured in the sample.

23
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:32,300
That could be the sample average x bar, or the sample standard deviation s. So,

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,140
the idea is that we will use the statistic from

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,780
the sample to estimate the parameter of the population.
