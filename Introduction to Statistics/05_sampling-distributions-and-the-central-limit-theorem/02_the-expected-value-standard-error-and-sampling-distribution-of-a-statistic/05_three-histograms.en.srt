1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,805
The technical term, distribution,

2
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:05,120
comes up in many different ways.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,740
It's helpful to step back and see what's happening here.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,055
When we toss the coin 100 times,

5
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:16,700
we simulate the data by drawing from the probability histogram.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,240
That probability histogram says we can get

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,250
heads with probability a half and tails with probability a half.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,110
So remember that the probability histogram is a theoretical construct.

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,180
It simply tells us what the chances are for simulating.

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,400
After we have simulated 100 tosses,

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,135
we have actual data.

12
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:47,090
For example, we could end up with 47 heads and 53 tails.

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,745
Then we can make a histogram of those data, and the histogram looks like this one.

14
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:55,390
So you see that this histogram looks quite

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,515
similar to the probability histogram in the first step,

16
00:00:58,515 --> 00:01:04,920
but it's a little bit different because the 100 tosses involve a chance process.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,225
Finally, if we are interested in a statistic,

18
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:12,090
such as the number of tails in 100 tosses,

19
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,295
then we get a third histogram,

20
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:18,605
which gives the sampling distribution of that statistic.

21
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:22,330
In this case, it's a binomial distribution,

22
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,165
and you'll see that this histogram is quite different from the first two.

23
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:28,815
Later on when we do statistical inference,

24
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:31,375
it's easy to mix up these histograms.

25
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:36,000
So it's really important to carefully think through what's going on there.
