1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,715
Now, if we draw an adult male at random from the population,

2
00:00:03,715 --> 00:00:07,880
then we expect his height to be around the population average mu,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,585
give or take about one standard deviation sigma.

4
00:00:11,585 --> 00:00:18,255
After all, the standard deviation sigma measures the spread of the population.

5
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:24,865
And most observations are around one standard deviation away from the mean mu.

6
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:31,810
We say that the expected value of one random draw is the population average mu.

7
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,975
Now, how about the average of n draws,

8
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:38,185
which we call x bar, with a subscript n?

9
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:41,735
So the subscript stands for the sample size.

10
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:47,045
So, it turns out that the expected value of the sample average is,

11
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:49,705
again, the population average mu.

12
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:54,050
But keep in mind that the sample average is actually random,

13
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,965
because sampling is a random process.

14
00:00:56,965 --> 00:01:01,225
That means that x bar won't be exactly equal to the population mean,

15
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:04,450
which is actually 69.3 inches.

16
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,920
For example, we might get x bar equal to 70.1 inches.

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,260
And if we take another sample of size n,

18
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,335
we might get x bar equal to 69.1 inches.

19
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:17,890
So then the question is,

20
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,935
how far off from the population mean will the sample mean be?

21
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:26,040
This is determined by the standard error, or SE.

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,625
This is a very important quantity in statistics,

23
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:35,835
and it tells you roughly how far off the statistic will be from an expected value.

24
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:42,175
The standard error for a statistic is used for all kinds of statistical procedures.

25
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:46,190
The standard error of a statistic plays the same role

26
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,500
that the standard deviation sigma plays for one observation drawn at random,

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,890
because it's a give or take number that shows how far

28
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,460
off we expect the statistic to be from the mean.

29
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,800
So, here's one of the key facts for a statistical inference,

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,995
it's called the square root law.

31
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:08,795
It says that, "the standard error of the sample average,

32
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,725
equals sigma, divided by square root of sample size".

33
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:15,430
Why is the square root law so important?

34
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,390
There are actually two reasons for that.

35
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,890
First, it shows that the standard error becomes smaller

36
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,330
if we use a larger sample size n. After all,

37
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,165
there's a square root in the denominator.

38
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:30,610
We can actually use that formula to determine what

39
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,590
sample size is required to get a desired accuracy for our standard error.

40
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,655
The second point is that the formula does not depend on the size of the population,

41
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:43,195
only on the size of the sample.

42
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:46,975
This is the reason why statistics works in polls.

43
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:49,775
After all, remember our previous example,

44
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:53,240
where we looked at 140 million adult men.

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,405
It doesn't really matter that we look at 140 million.

46
00:02:57,405 --> 00:03:00,845
If we take a sample of size 1,000,

47
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:06,000
we get a certain standard error, no matter how large the population is.
