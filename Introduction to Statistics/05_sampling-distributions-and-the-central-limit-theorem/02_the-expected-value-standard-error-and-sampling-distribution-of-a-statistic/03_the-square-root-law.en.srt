1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,435
So now, let's look at an example that applies the square root law.

2
00:00:04,435 --> 00:00:07,405
We toss a fair coin 100 times,

3
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:12,160
how many tails do we expect to see and what's the give or take number?

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,010
This is an example where we count.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,115
We count how many tails we're going to see in 100 tosses.

6
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:28,610
So we'll introduce labels, where a 1 stands for tails and a 0 stands for heads. Then,

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,690
we simulate this 100 tosses either by literally tossing a coin

8
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:37,010
100 times or by using a computer, and in each case,

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,835
we have the probability of getting a 1 is a

10
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:44,390
half and the probability of getting a 0 is also a half.

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,800
Because we have 0 and 1 labels,

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:57,100
we find that the number of tails in the 100 tosses equals the sum of the 100 draws.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,660
So then we can use our formula for the expected value of the sum and it says,

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,325
it's the sample size which is 100 times Mu.

15
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:14,530
Now the formula for Mu on the previous slide says,

16
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:21,195
it's the sum of all outcomes times their probabilities and that is a half.

17
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:26,200
So the expected value of the sum is 50 and that would be our answer,

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,960
we expect to see 50 tails.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,060
Now the give or take number is the standard error.

20
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,550
So we have to look at the standard error of the sum and the formula says,

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,560
this is square root sample size times Sigma.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,130
So we have to figure out what Sigma is,

23
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,120
the formula for Sigma square is,

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,715
take each outcome, subtract off the mean,

25
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:55,800
square it, times the probability which is a half, and then we have to do

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,485
that for the second outcome, and we find this is one-quarter.

27
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:05,130
So now since we are looking at Sigma, not Sigma squared,

28
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,780
we get 10 times one-half instead of a quarter and that is 5.

29
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,675
So our answer would be,

30
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:17,125
that we expect to see 50 tails, give or take five.

31
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:21,090
By the way, if we did this for the percentage of tails,

32
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,070
then the formula for the percentage says,

33
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:32,740
we take Sigma over square root of sample size and that is 0.05, or 5%.

34
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,020
So in terms of percentages,

35
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,360
our answer would be,

36
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,870
we expect to see 50% tails give or take 5 percentage points.
