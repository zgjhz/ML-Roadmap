1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,925
Sometimes we are interested in the sum of the n draws rather than the average.

2
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:08,540
Now, we get the average by taking the sum and dividing by n,

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,525
and so we get the sum back by taking n times the average.

4
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:17,010
So, it turns out that the formulas for the expected value and the standard error of

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,855
the sum can simply be obtained by multiplying the formulas

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:26,760
for the sample mean by n. The important thing to keep in mind here is that

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,000
the standard error for the sum actually increases at a rate of square root n. So,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,150
while the standard error of the average goes down,

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,675
the standard error of the sum goes up.

10
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:43,560
Another important statistic that comes up all the time are percentages.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,655
We already looked at approval ratings for US presidents.

12
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:51,300
That's a question that was introduced by George Gallup in the late

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,565
1930s, and it's asked regularly every week or so.

14
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:58,620
That poll tries to figure out what percentage of

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,930
likely voters approve of the way that the US President is handling his job.

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,460
Looking closely at this,

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,425
we see that the percentage of likely voters is actually an average.

18
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:14,570
It's helpful to look at this in somewhat detail because it comes up all the time.

19
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,910
It's called a framework for counting and classifying.

20
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,285
In this example, the population consists of

21
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:24,415
all likely voters which are about 140 million adults.

22
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:28,205
Each of these likely voters falls into one of two categories,

23
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:32,165
either they approve of the President's handling of the job, or they don't.

24
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:35,615
What do we do now is we put the label '1' on

25
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:40,975
each likely voter who approves and '0' on each who doesn't approve.

26
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:45,830
The reason we do that is because then the number of likely voters

27
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,780
who approve equals the sum of all 140 million labels.

28
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,330
To see why that is,

29
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,195
let's look at a simple example with five voters.

30
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:59,225
Suppose the first voter approves,

31
00:01:59,225 --> 00:02:01,165
so we give him a label '1'.

32
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:03,050
The second voter doesn't,

33
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,780
so he gets a label '0'.

34
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,775
The third voter doesn't, gets a label '0'.

35
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:10,280
The next voter approves, gets a label '1',

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,010
and the last voter doesn't, and gets a label '0'.

37
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,950
So, if we look at the sum of the labels,

38
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,950
then that will be 2, and indeed 2 of

39
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,045
the 5 voters approved of the President's handling of his job.

40
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,730
So by putting 0s and 1s on the labels,

41
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,680
the sum of the labels simply counts how many approve,

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,970
and likewise one sees that the percentage of likely voters who

43
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,390
approve is simply the percentage of 1s among all the labels.

44
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,465
So, if we introduce labels,

45
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:49,950
then sampling n likely voters means that the number of voters

46
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,480
in the sample who are approving is simply the sum of the n draws.

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,870
Likewise, the percentage of voters approving is

48
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,935
the percentage of 1s, and that's then simply the sample average.

49
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:08,790
And we can multiply by 100% just to convert the whole thing into percentages.

50
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,330
So, the bottom line is that percentages are

51
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,140
simply averages after introducing 0 and 1 labels.

52
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,870
That means we can simply use the formulas for averages and we

53
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,950
find that the expected value of the percentage of 1s is Mu times 100%,

54
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,820
and the standard error for the percentage of 1s is sigma over square root n times 100%,

55
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,870
where mu is the population average and sigma

56
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,695
is the standard deviation of the population of 0s and 1s.

57
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:44,500
So now, we have a number of formulas for the average,

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,825
for the sum and for the percentages.

59
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:48,995
But really, they all look quite similar.

60
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:54,540
In the end, it comes down to sigma over square root n. But remember that all

61
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,760
of these formulas are actually for sampling with

62
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,165
replacement, but polls are simple random samples.

63
00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:02,649
So, those are samples without replacement.

64
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:07,060
Now, we already saw that in the case of sampling without replacement,

65
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,235
where the sample size is much smaller than the size of the population,

66
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:13,605
these two things are roughly the same,

67
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:16,820
so all of these formulas are still approximately true.

68
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,030
In fact, it turns out the formulas for

69
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,920
the expected values are exactly true even for sampling without replacement

70
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,580
and for the standard error it's only approximately true and

71
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,940
they are explicit formulas to correct for sampling without replacement.

72
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,290
All of these formulas are also true if we don't

73
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,510
draw from a population but we simulate data.

74
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:45,180
Simulating data means we generate data according to a probability histogram, for example,

75
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,710
by using a computer.

76
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,470
Now, what are mu and sigma in that case?

77
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,980
Remember, when we draw from a population,

78
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,714
mu is simply the population average and sigma is the population standard deviation.

79
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:03,775
If we simulate a random variable X that has K possible outcomes,

80
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:10,180
X1 to XK, then the formulas for mu and sigma square are given here.

81
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,700
These formulas actually also apply to the case of sampling from

82
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:21,120
a population, because if we sample from a population with K possible subjects,

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
then the probability of picking one subject is simply 1

84
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,130
over K and the whole thing becomes the population mean.

85
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,260
Likewise for sigma square,

86
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,245
where this formula simply turns into the formula

87
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:37,870
for the population standard deviation squared.

88
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,305
In the case where the random variable X has

89
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:45,070
infinitely many possible outcomes such as when X follows the normal curve,

90
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:51,000
they are analogous formulas, but we don't need these for the rest of the course.
