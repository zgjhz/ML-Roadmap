1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,525
Now let's go back to the online game,

2
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:07,945
which we considered earlier where you win a small prize with probability 0.2.

3
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:11,650
We gamble n times and count a number of

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,095
small prizes, and we called this a random variable X.

5
00:00:16,095 --> 00:00:22,915
At that time we saw that X has a binomial distribution with n, and p = 0.2.

6
00:00:22,915 --> 00:00:27,355
Here are some probability histograms for that binomial distribution.

7
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:30,980
If n = 1, we see that it's

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:37,960
a very much skewed histogram, and for n = 10 it still has a long right tail.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,960
But for n = 50, the whole thing looks pretty much like a normal curve.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,805
This is an example of the famous central limit theorem.

11
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:52,205
It says that when we sample with replacement and n is large,

12
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:55,690
then the sampling distribution of the sample average, or of

13
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,555
the sum, or of the percentage approximately follows the normal curve.

14
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:06,665
That means we can use normal approximation to compute probabilities.

15
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:09,180
To standardize, we subtract off

16
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,660
the expected value of this statistic, and then divide by its standard error.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,050
The name central limit theorem comes from

18
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,820
the fact that it has a central place in statistical theory.

19
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,430
The reason why the central limit theorem is so important is that it shows

20
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,810
that the statistic has a normal distribution no matter what the population histogram is.

21
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,280
Let's look back at the distribution of annual household incomes in the United States.

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,150
We saw that this distribution is very much skewed to the right.

23
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,205
So it's very far from normal.

24
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:53,690
The mean of the household incomes was $67,000, and the standard deviation was $38,000.

25
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:59,325
So, if we sample n incomes at random among all the households,

26
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:04,180
then we know that the sample average follows the normal curve,

27
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,885
even though the histogram of the incomes itself is far from normal.

28
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:11,235
And to do normal approximation,

29
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:15,015
we need to subtract off the expected value of the statistic,

30
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:20,835
which in this case is the average of all incomes, namely $67,000.

31
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:26,740
And then we have to divide by the standard error of the statistic and we know by

32
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,410
the square root law that one is $38,000 over the square root of the sample size.

33
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,935
For example, let's take 100 incomes.

34
00:02:35,935 --> 00:02:37,740
If n = 100,

35
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:46,155
then square root n is 10, and so the standard error is equal to $3,800.

36
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:52,730
The central limit theorem says that a sample mean follows the normal curve centered

37
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:59,900
at $67,000, with a standard error of $3,800.

38
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,520
So the empirical rule says,

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,255
if we go one standard error above the average,

40
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:12,235
then there's a 16% chance to fall above that number.

41
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:21,750
And one standard error above average is precisely that $70,800 we were looking at.

42
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,970
Let's go back to our example about online gambling.

43
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:32,090
We did n gambles, and looked at the number of small prizes which we called X.

44
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,510
Remember when counting things,

45
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,605
we use labels which have 0s and 1s on them.

46
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:40,545
In that case, every time a small prize comes up,

47
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:44,165
we give it a label 1, and 0 goes to everything else.

48
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:47,080
That means that the number of small prizes,

49
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,010
simply equals the sum of these labels.

50
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,130
And since we are now looking at the sum,

51
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,560
we can use the central limit theorem.

52
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,225
To apply normal approximation,

53
00:03:57,225 --> 00:04:02,205
we need to find the mean and the standard error of x.

54
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:05,120
So remember when we looked at simulations, we had

55
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,560
formulas for the expected value and the standard error.

56
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,120
And if you plug in,

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,585
you'll find that in this case mu = p and sigma is

58
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:22,150
square root p times 1 - p. That was the formula for one gamble.

59
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,930
Now we are looking at the sum of n gambles and we had formulas

60
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,480
for the expected value and standard error, and these formulas show that

61
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,150
the expected value of the sum X = n times p and the standard error is

62
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,940
square root n times p times 1 - p.

63
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,590
Those are the numbers we use when we standardize x.

64
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,070
And remember, we found the same thing when we talked about the binomial distribution.
