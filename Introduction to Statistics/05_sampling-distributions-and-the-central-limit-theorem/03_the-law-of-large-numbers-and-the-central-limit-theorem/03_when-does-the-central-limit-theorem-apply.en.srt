00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Let's summarize the main requirements for the central limit theorem to apply.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,190
First, we need to sample with replacement or we need to

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,140
simulate independent random variables from the same distribution.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,050
It turns out there are actually also

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,315
central limit theorems for sampling without replacement.

6
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:19,820
And in any case,

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,155
we know that if the sample size is much smaller than the population size,

8
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:28,215
then sampling without replacement is about the same as sampling with replacement.

9
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:30,100
And so, everything works out.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,720
The second important requirement is that the statistic we are looking at must be a sum.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,300
And remember that averages and percentages are essentially sums after multiplying.

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,915
Finally, the sample size has to be large enough.

13
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:50,375
The rule of thumb is that the more skewed the underlying population histogram is,

14
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:56,810
the larger the required sample size n. It turns out that if there's no strong skewness,

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,815
then a sample size of at least 15 will be sufficient.

16
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:02,545
For a stronger skewness,

17
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:06,000
we might need a sample size of at least 40.
