1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,650
The square root law means that the standard error of

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,190
the sample mean goes down as the sample size increases.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,460
This means that if the sample size is large enough,

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,500
then the sample mean will be close to its expected value mu.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,895
This is the famous law of large numbers.

6
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:25,600
So keep in mind that the law of large numbers applies only for averages and percentages,

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,140
but it doesn't apply for sums, because we saw that

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,100
the standard error of the sum goes up as the sample size increases.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,955
Also, we need to be sampling with replacement from a population,

10
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:43,785
or simulating the data with a computer from a probability histogram.

11
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:47,790
More sophisticated versions of the law of large numbers in

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,830
fact state that the whole empirical histogram of the data,

13
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,755
which is the second histogram among the three we considered previously,

14
00:00:55,755 --> 00:01:01,000
would be close to the probability histogram if the sample size is large enough.
