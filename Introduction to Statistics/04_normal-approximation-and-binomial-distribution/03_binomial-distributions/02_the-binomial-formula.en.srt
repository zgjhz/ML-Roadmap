1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,145
Now we can use the binomial coefficient to compute

2
00:00:04,145 --> 00:00:07,950
the probability of k successes in n experiments.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,645
So here's the answer.

4
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:14,440
This binomial coefficient we already saw, it counts the number of

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:21,135
ways to arrange k successes in n experiments.

6
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:28,025
And then what we have is this term p to the power k,

7
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:35,590
times 1 - p to the power n - k and that is simply the probability of

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:44,775
having a particular pattern of k successes and n - k failures.

9
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:48,985
And that is because if you want to have k successes,

10
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:52,575
it's p to the power k, because they're independent,

11
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:58,735
and each failure has probability 1 - p. And since we have n - k of them,

12
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:05,025
we raise it to the power n - k. This formula is called the binomial probability.

13
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:09,095
So let's do an example about binomial probabilities.

14
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:12,265
Suppose you play an online game 10 times.

15
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:14,985
Each time there are three possible outcomes.

16
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:18,415
You can win a big prize with probability 10%,

17
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:21,745
you can win a small prize with probably 20%,

18
00:01:21,745 --> 00:01:25,000
and you win nothing with probability 70%.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,650
The question is, what is the probability to win two small prizes?

20
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,620
Now it would seem that this is actually not

21
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,455
the binomial setting, because after all, we have three possible outcomes.

22
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:42,210
But if you look at the question, you see you are asked to

23
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,130
compute the probability of two small prizes.

24
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,330
It doesn't talk at all about big prizes.

25
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,015
So this is, after all, an example of the binomial setting where

26
00:01:54,015 --> 00:01:58,715
success means you win a small prize,

27
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:03,840
and failure means anything else, that is,

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:13,110
you win a big prize or you win nothing.

29
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,370
So in the binomial setting,

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:24,730
our probability becomes the probability of having 2 successes in 10 experiments.

31
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:30,990
And for that we can use the binomial formula, we have n is 10,

32
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,935
so there's 10 factorial.

33
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,770
Then k is 2,

34
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,920
so there's 2 factorial,

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,060
and 10 - 2 is 8,

36
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,585
so there's 8 factorial.

37
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:47,485
Then the probability of success is 0.2.

38
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:52,395
And that has to be raised to 2 because we want to have two successes.

39
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:57,680
The probability of failure is 1 - 0.2,

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,135
and that has to be raised to the power 8 because 8 is 10 - 2.

41
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:13,315
So now we write 10 factorial as 10 times 9, times 8 factorial.

42
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:15,910
Remember 8 factorial means 8

43
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,225
times 7 times 6, and so on, so we can write it that way.

44
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:24,920
2 factorial is simply 2 and I leave the 8 factorial there.

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,935
Then we keep the 0.2 to the power 2, times 0.8 to the power 8.

46
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:37,345
And now you see you can cancel the 8 factorial and you are left with

47
00:03:37,345 --> 00:03:43,315
45 times 0.2 to the power 2,

48
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:46,685
times 0.8 to the power 8.

49
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,050
And if you plug this in your calculator,

50
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,850
you'll see this is 30.2%.
