1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,585
Now, keep in mind that the outcomes of the 10 experiments are due to chance,

2
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:09,305
so the number of successes you see are random.

3
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:13,625
One set of 10 experiments might give you 4 successes.

4
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,905
Another set might result in 7.

5
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:20,320
For that reason, the number of successes is called a random variable.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,070
To make the notation easy,

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,180
we simply write a letter for it,

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,365
like X just like in math,

9
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:30,310
but we use capital letters to make clear that this is a random variable.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,770
So, on the previous slide,

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,405
we computed the probability of having 2 successes.

12
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,760
And in that notation,

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,110
that would simply be the probability that X is 2,

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,430
and we found that's 30.2%.

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,265
Since these were binomial probabilities,

16
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:52,120
one says that the random variable X has the binomial distribution.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,720
Instead of computing the probabilities of all possible outcomes,

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,425
we can simply visualize those probabilities with what's called a probability histogram.

19
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:04,990
In the case of a binomial distribution with

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:10,880
n = 10 experiments and the probability of success of P = 0.2,

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,210
the probability histogram looks like this.

22
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,800
The probability histogram is simply a bar graph,

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,805
where the height of the bar shows the probability of the corresponding outcome.

24
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:29,695
For example we saw that the probability of getting X = 2 is roughly 30%,

25
00:01:29,695 --> 00:01:31,880
and that's the height of this bar.

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,780
So here is the same probability histogram we had on the previous slide.

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,750
Now, remember we talked about histograms before.

28
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,935
In that case, we talked about histograms for data.

29
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:47,225
And histograms of data give percentages for observed data,

30
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:52,475
but keep in mind that the probability histogram has nothing to do with observed data.

31
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:55,050
It's purely a theoretical construct.

32
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,730
It shows probabilities, not data that have been actually observed.
