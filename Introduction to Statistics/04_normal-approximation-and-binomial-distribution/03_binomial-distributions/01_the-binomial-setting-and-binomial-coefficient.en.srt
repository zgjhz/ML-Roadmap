1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
So, we saw earlier that for a newborn baby,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,885
there's about a 49% chance that it is a girl.

3
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:10,500
Now, what are the chances that if we look at three newborns,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,075
we have two girls?

5
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:15,445
So, if we think back about the section on probability,

6
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:19,650
we can compute this by simply listing all the possibilities.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,510
Remember we called this total enumeration.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,140
So, the probability that two out of three newborns are

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,630
girls would be that we have a girl,

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,195
another girl, and a boy,

11
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:33,790
or we have a girl,

12
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,345
a boy and a girl, or a boy and a girl, and a girl.

13
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:43,740
Then we can simply add up these three terms because of the addition rule.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,600
Remember, for the addition rule we required

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,975
that the events are mutually exclusive, which they are.

16
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:55,750
And finally, we can use the multiplication rule on each of these three probabilities,

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,885
because the three pairs are independent.

18
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:06,415
So, what we end up with is a term three for the three terms in the sum,

19
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:11,230
and then we have 0.49 for the probability of a girl here,

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,885
0.49 for the probability of a girl,

21
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:16,880
and 0.51 for the probability of a boy.

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,895
The three counts the number of ways we can arrange two girls and one boy,

23
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:24,465
and the product 0.49 times,

24
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:31,220
0.49 times 0.51, is the same for all three terms.

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,380
The calculation that we did on

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,950
the previous slide was an example of what's called the binomial setting.

27
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:45,130
We had three repetitions of an experiment and these repetitions were independent.

28
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:51,065
In our example, an experiment was simply giving birth to a child.

29
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:55,570
Each of these experiments has two possible outcomes.

30
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:01,305
In our example, these were the sex of the child, a girl or a boy.

31
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:03,425
And in the binomial setting,

32
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:07,875
these two outcomes are generically called success and failure.

33
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:12,110
Success is typically the outcome we are interested in.

34
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,215
So, in our example,

35
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:17,655
this would be that the newborn is a girl.

36
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:22,075
And finally, the probability of success, which was 49%,

37
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,320
was the same in each experiment.

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,830
These three conditions define what's called the binomial setting.

39
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,550
Now, let's look at a little bit more challenging problem.

40
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,630
What's the probability that 2 out of 5 newborns are girls?

41
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,735
In principle, we can compute this just as before.

42
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:42,360
So, now we have to look at

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,440
all the possibilities how we can arrange 2 girls among 5 newborns.

44
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,590
And it turns out there are now 10 of these possibilities.

45
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,995
I wrote down the first three here.

46
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:55,760
You could have a girl-girl,

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,010
boy-boy-boy, or girl-boy,

48
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,270
girl-boy-boy, and you get the idea.

49
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,590
So, the problem is that the number of

50
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,965
these possibilities grows very quickly as n gets larger.

51
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:11,165
But fortunately, there's a formula for computing those.

52
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:15,510
That formula is given by the binomial coefficient which counts

53
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,540
the number of ways one can arrange k successes in n experiments.

54
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:28,860
The formula reads n factorial so that exclamation mark is pronounced as factorial.

55
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,860
n factorial simply means,

56
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,860
you multiply up all the numbers up to n. For example,

57
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,060
if we look at 3 factorial,

58
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,765
that would be 1 times 2 times 3, which is 6.

59
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:53,015
Then we have to divide by k factorial and n - k factorial.

60
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,765
As a special case,

61
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,985
0 factorial is always 1.

62
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:59,375
In our previous example,

63
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,490
we had n = 3 births,

64
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:07,160
and we wanted to know what are the chances to get k = 2 girls.

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,270
So, we have to compute 3 factorial over 2 factorial times 1 factorial,

66
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,855
which gives us 3.

67
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:17,000
And that's exactly what we got when we did it by hand.
