1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,800
So if you look at
the probability histogram for

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,460
the binomial with 10 experiments and
a probability of success of 0.2,

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,830
you see that that histogram
looks somewhat skewed.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,580
So there is a long right tail.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,940
But if we increase the number
of experiments to 50, then

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,840
you see that the corresponding probability
histogram looks rather symmetric, and

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,100
in fact it looks close
to the normal curve.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,530
This suggests that we can use normal
approximation to compute binomial

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,450
probabilities, just as we used normal
approximation before to compute

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,850
frequencies for data.

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,210
To use normal approximation for
binomial probabilities,

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,760
we need to standardize by
subtracting off n times p and

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,749
then dividing by square root np(1-p).

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,150
Let's look at an example
of how to do that.

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,870
A few slides ago,
we were playing the online game where

16
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,410
the probability of winning
a small prize was 0.2.

17
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,150
Now let's say we play this game 50 times,

18
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,750
what is the probability of
getting at most 12 small prizes?

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,710
We already know that this
is the binomial setting, so

20
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,480
we could use binomial probabilities,
but this is rather tedious work.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,840
We would have to compute the probabilities
of having 0 successes plus

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,440
the probability of having 1 success, plus
the probability of having 2 successes, and

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,980
so on, all the way up to 12.

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,740
On the other hand,

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,470
if we use normal approximation, then
this is a rather quick computation.

26
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,160
Remember that the probability histogram
of the binomial distribution with

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,840
n = 50 and p = 0.2 looks

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,040
roughly like a normal curve
which is centered at around 10.

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,650
Now we want to compute the probability
of at most 12 successes.

30
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:06,560
So here's 12, and that means we want to
compute the shaded area to the left of 12.

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,440
So we know in order to
do normal approximation,

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,920
we first have to standardize.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,186
To standardize, we have to subtract off np,

34
00:02:17,186 --> 00:02:22,597
so we take 12,
we subtract off n times p and

35
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:27,739
we divide by square root np(1- p).

36
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:36,379
So we take 12 - 10 / 2.83,

37
00:02:39,497 --> 00:02:42,383
And that gives us 0.71.

38
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:47,600
So after we standardize, we get
a standard normal curve which

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,640
is centered around 0, and
the standardized value for 12 is 0.71.

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,533
And so we have to find the area under the
standard normal curve to the left of 0.71.

41
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:04,828
Plugging this into software, we
see that this area is roughly 76%,

42
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:08,520
and that's going to be
the answer to our question.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,710
Remember that when we
talked about sampling,

44
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:18,340
we know that that a poll typically selects
subjects in a simple random sample,

45
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,250
and that means sampling
without replacement.

46
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,359
If one is sampling without replacement,
then this is not the binomial setting.

47
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:33,620
For example, the probability of success p
changes after a subject has been removed.

48
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,460
But if the population we sample from
is much larger than the sample,

49
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,210
then sampling with replacement is about
the same as sampling without replacement.

50
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,070
So in that case, even if we take a simple
random sample, that is, we sample without

51
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:54,040
replacement, the number of successes
will be approximately binomial,

52
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,360
and that means we will be able
to use normal approximation.
