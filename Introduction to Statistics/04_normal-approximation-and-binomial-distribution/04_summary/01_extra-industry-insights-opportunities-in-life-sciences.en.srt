00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,760
In life sciences in general, data
science is being applied across

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,930
the spectrum, right? So we're working in
the earliest stages of drug discovery.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,182
But there's certainly work that data
science can do to help optimize

4
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:13,087
clinical trials.

5
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:17,231
So part of having an effective drug
therapy is knowing in advance whether or

6
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:19,664
not that medication would work for
you, and

7
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:22,186
maybe you've had this experience, right?

8
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:25,625
You go to your doctor, you're not feeling
well, you're given a prescription, and

9
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,869
then the doctor says, and
if this doesn't work, right,

10
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,481
come back in a couple weeks and
we'll try something different.

11
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:34,670
And so part of what's going on there is
that your genetic makeup as an individual,

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,360
and sort of you as a biological entity,

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,370
you might react differently to
a medication than someone else.

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,346
And so, some of the other work
that data science can help with,

15
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:45,370
is some of those companion
diagnostics, right,

16
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,390
to figure out which treatments would
be most effective with which people.

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,240
This is not work that we do as a company,
but these are all opportunities where

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,330
artificial intelligence, data science
helps make people healthier as a whole.
