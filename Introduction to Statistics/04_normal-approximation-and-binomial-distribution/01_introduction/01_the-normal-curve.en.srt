1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
We will now look at the empirical rule, and norm approximation for data.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,530
This is an important technique in statistics, because it is used in many statistical procedures.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,830
We will also discuss the binomial distribution, and some basic ideas about random variables.

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,830
It turns out that many data have histograms which have a very characteristic shape.

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:30,830
Heights, weights, IQ scores, and many other data have a histogram which has a bell shape.

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:39,530
The histogram that you see here shows the heights of 928 fathers that were collected

7
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,530
by Sir Francis Galton in the 19th century.

8
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,530
This is a typical example of a bell-shaped histogram.

9
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:55,030
In such a case, one says that the data follow the normal curve.

10
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,050
But keep in mind that some data have histograms that are quite different.

11
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,000
We already saw that when we looked at incomes.
