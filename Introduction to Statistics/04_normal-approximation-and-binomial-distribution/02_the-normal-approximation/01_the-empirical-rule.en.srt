1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,445
It turns out that if the data follow the normal curve,

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:08,195
then there's a rule of thumb which comes in handy in many situations.

3
00:00:08,195 --> 00:00:13,485
About two-thirds of the data fall within one standard deviation of the mean.

4
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:16,355
This is called the empirical rule.

5
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:20,320
There's a second part to the empirical rule which says that

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,395
about 95% of the data fall within two standard deviations of the mean.

7
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:31,250
And in fact, about all of the data fall within three standard deviations of the mean.

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,965
Let's look at an example.

9
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:38,840
We saw that the height measurements of the fathers have a mean of

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,785
68.3 inches and a standard deviation of 1.8 inches.

11
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:48,500
Now, the second part of the empirical rule says that

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,050
95% of the data fall within two standard deviations of the mean.

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,480
That means, if I go two standard deviations below the mean,

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,990
that is, I take the mean minus two standard deviations,

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,720
and I go two standard deviations above the mean,

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,280
then I can tell that 95% of the height measurements fall

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,550
between 64.7 inches and 71.9 inches.

18
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:22,145
Let's see how the empirical rule looks like when we draw a histogram.

19
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:24,530
Recall that in a histogram,

20
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,480
percentages are given by areas.

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,475
So, if I draw a histogram that looks bell-shaped,

22
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:36,795
then the mean is right in the middle.

23
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:40,255
And if I go one standard deviation above

24
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:45,610
the mean and one standard deviation below the mean,

25
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:53,240
then the empirical rule says that 68% of the data fall between these two numbers.

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,510
Now, can I say something about how many data

27
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:01,615
are bigger than one standard deviation above the mean?

28
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:05,305
Well, I know if 68% fall in the middle,

29
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:08,380
that leaves 32% on the outside.

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,455
And since the histogram is symmetric,

31
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:12,090
it must be half on each side.

32
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,570
So this would be roughly 16%.

33
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:22,640
Now, let's look at the second part of the empirical rule.

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,270
The second part talks about going two standard deviations in each direction.

35
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,395
So, here's my mean,

36
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:34,825
here's the mean plus two standard deviations,

37
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:39,395
and here's the mean minus two standard deviations.

38
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:45,725
And then I know that 95% of the data fall between these two numbers.

39
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:50,040
So that leaves me 5% outside,

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,000
and in particular, I get 2.5% on each side.
