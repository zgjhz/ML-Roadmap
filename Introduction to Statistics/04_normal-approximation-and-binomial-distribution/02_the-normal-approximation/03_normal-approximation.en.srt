00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
Normal approximation means to use the area under the normal curve to figure percentages.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,095
Let's look at an example.

3
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:18,410
What percentage of fathers have heights between 67.4 inches and 71.9 inches?

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,250
Remember that we know the mean and the standard deviation

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,860
for those data and that's really all we need to know.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,315
Normal approximation consists of four steps.

7
00:00:29,315 --> 00:00:30,640
In the first steps,

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,080
we standardize the data.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,975
That means, we take the endpoint, 67.4 inches,

10
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:41,115
and we subtract of the mean,

11
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:43,275
divide by standard deviation,

12
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:47,460
and we get a standardized value of -0.5.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,405
Then we do the same thing with the other endpoint of 71.9 inches,

14
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:56,130
and we get a z score of 2.

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,920
In the second step,

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,930
we mark the area on the histogram we're interested in.

17
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:10,430
67.4 is somewhere here and 71.9 is here.

18
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,360
So, we want to know the shaded area in that histogram.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,280
Once we standardize, we get

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,950
a standard normal curve and we've

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,165
seen that the left endpoint gets standardized to -0.5,

22
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:34,870
and the right endpoint gets standardized to 2.

23
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:41,930
So now, we have to find the shaded area under the standard normal curve.

24
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:49,915
At this point, we use a computer or a table to look up that area.

25
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:54,960
That requires us to do a small extra step,

26
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:03,120
because typically, software requires us to look at areas that come in a certain form.

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,840
Typically, we can look at the area to the left of a given value.

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:17,170
In our example, we were interested in the area between -0.5 and 2.

29
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,265
Since software can give us only the value to the left of a number,

30
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:29,295
we have to rewrite the whole thing accordingly.

31
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:32,290
So, what we are going to do is,

32
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:38,510
we write this as all of the area to the left of 2,

33
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:47,850
and then we subtract off the area to the left of -0.5.

34
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:56,780
Both of these areas can be looked up in computer programs.

35
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,210
Once we look at these areas with software, or on a table,

36
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:08,615
we find that the first one is 97.7% and the second one is 30.9%.

37
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:15,315
And so, the area we're interested in is simply the difference, which is 66.8%.

38
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:19,210
By now, you've probably realized that

39
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,210
the empirical rule is simply a special case of normal approximation.

40
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,920
Remember, the empirical rule says that there's 95% of

41
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,090
the data between the standardized values of -2 and 2.

42
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,250
That leaves us 2.5% to the left of -2.

43
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:47,810
So, the total area to the left of 2 is 2.5% + 95%,

44
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,805
and that gives us 97.5%.

45
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:56,850
So, this rule of thumb is very close to the

46
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,920
97.7% that we got on the previous slide using software.
