1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,780
A nice fact about the normal curve is,

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,200
that it is completely determined by the mean and the standard deviation.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,405
Once we know the mean and the standard deviation,

4
00:00:10,405 --> 00:00:14,560
then we know the whole histogram and we can compute percentages.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,535
To do that, we first standardize the data.

6
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:23,035
Standardizing means that we take the data, in this case,

7
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:29,115
the height measurements and we subtract of the mean and divide by the standard deviation.

8
00:00:29,115 --> 00:00:35,115
Oftentimes, the resulting standardized data is denoted by z.

9
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:39,615
It's called a standardized value or a z-score.

10
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:43,340
Now keep in mind that z has no units.

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,355
In this example where we looked at heights,

12
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:48,090
heights come in inches,

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,450
and the mean and the standard deviation all come in inches,

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,110
but the z-scores have no units whatsoever,

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,550
and that's simply because we have inches in

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,925
the numerator and we have inches in the denominator,

17
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,850
and so the inches cancel out.

18
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:11,285
Z tells you how many standard deviations the measurement is above or below average.

19
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:14,680
For example, if z = 2,

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,565
that means the height is two standard deviations above average.

21
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:20,955
If z is -1.5,

22
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:26,355
then we know that the height is 1.5 standard deviations below average.

23
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:28,550
Once we standardize the data,

24
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,320
they have mean 0 and standard deviation equal to 1.

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,130
This is the whole point of the exercise.

26
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,600
We already saw that fathers' heights follow the normal curve with a mean of

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,645
68.3 inches and a standard deviation of 1.8 inches.

28
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:49,220
After we standardize, the standardized values follow what's

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,260
called the standard normal curve which has mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

30
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,920
Here's a graph of the standard normal curve.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,540
You can plot this graph using the equation y = 1 over

32
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,840
square root 2 pi times e to -1/2 x-squared.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,510
Don't worry, we are not going to use that formula in this class.
