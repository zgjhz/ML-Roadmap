00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:04,957
Let's look at another example to see
what normal approximation can do for us.

2
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:11,505
Recall that the 30th percentile is the
point where 30% of the data fall below.

3
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:16,530
So if I draw a standard normal curve,

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,177
then the 30th percentile
would be the z value,

5
00:00:23,177 --> 00:00:28,212
where 30% of the data fall below.

6
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:31,609
Using a table of software,

7
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:36,492
one can find that that z is -0.52.

8
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:41,443
Now, we have to figure out how to
go from that z value to the 30th

9
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:43,659
percentile of the heights.

10
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:47,385
That means simply doing
the standardization backwards.

11
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:55,908
Remember that the z value is height minus
mean divided by standard deviation.

12
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:59,486
Now we know what z is, and
we already know what the mean and

13
00:00:59,486 --> 00:01:01,284
the standard deviation is.

14
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:08,598
So we can simply solve for height,
all we have to do is plug in the numbers.

15
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:12,267
Now there is a second way
of doing this problem.

16
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:18,084
Remember z tells you how many standard
deviations you are above or below average.

17
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:26,815
So z = -0.52 means that the height is
0.52 standard deviations below average.

18
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:35,777
So the height would be the average,
0.52 standard deviations,

19
00:01:35,777 --> 00:01:41,224
and then plugging in the numbers,
we get 67.4 inches.
