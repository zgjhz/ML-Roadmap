00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,275
Here are some more important points on ANOVA.

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:05,820
The F-test that we looked at assumes that

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,980
all the groups have the same variance sigma squared.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,810
This needs to be checked.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:15,075
One way to roughly check it is simply look at the side-by-side boxplots,

6
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:17,935
but there are also formal tests that can be used for that.

7
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,520
Another assumption that we used was that

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,605
the data are independent within and across groups.

9
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:28,820
If the data we get are the results of a randomized controlled experiment,

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,570
then this randomization condition would be met.

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,985
On the other hand, if the data were obtained from an observational study,

12
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:40,055
then we have to be careful with the analysis.

13
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:43,800
Not only may the assumptions not be met,

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,800
but we have to be careful with the conclusion, because remember,

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,110
if we have an observational study,

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,820
we cannot conclude that there is causation going on, because there could be confounders.

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,960
Finally, suppose we do the ANOVA and the F-test rejects.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,525
So, the conclusion is that the group means are not all equal.

19
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:08,150
The next question then is how are they different?

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:14,890
One way to look more closely at those differences would be to use the two-sample t-tests,

21
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,375
comparing all possible pairs of means.

22
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:23,445
In this case, one would use the pooled standard deviation for the t-test.

23
00:01:23,445 --> 00:01:26,100
This is simply the within group variation.

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,580
So, it's the square root of the error mean square,

25
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,765
but since we would look at many of such comparisons,

26
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:37,150
we have to be a little bit careful with our tests and have to make an adjustment.

27
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,330
We will talk about this in the next module.
