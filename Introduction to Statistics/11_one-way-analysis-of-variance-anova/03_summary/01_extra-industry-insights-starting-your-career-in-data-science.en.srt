1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,070
Yeah, I think for new people that come into the field,

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:10,675
you'll quickly realize that there are massive amounts of tools that you can use,

3
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:13,725
whether that's choices in database technologies,

4
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:16,260
language to process that

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,125
those database systems with different machine learning algorithms.

6
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:23,510
And so, that can be very overwhelming,

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,620
just to sort of examine all of

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,180
the possibilities of what you could use from a language perspective,

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,230
tools perspective, et cetera.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,980
My advice would be, start small,

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,215
gain expertise in a particular tool or in that area, and then expand.

12
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:42,280
I think that there's a reason why

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,430
so many different languages have been built over

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,915
the years in so many different database technologies.

15
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:49,540
They all solved very different problems.

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,540
And as you become more and more of an expert in understanding these tools,

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,400
when you go to solve a problem,

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,270
you can pull out the right tools from

19
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,670
the tool box and piece them together to get the best solution.

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,320
And so, that breadth of understanding, again,

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,385
it can be very overwhelming at times,

22
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:07,055
but I wouldn't let that scare you.

23
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:12,425
I would actually encourage you to try to explore as many of those things as you can.

24
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:17,190
Data for me, and data science is a way to sort of understand our world,

25
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,750
and it can be applied to so many different things.

26
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,935
And so, if you have a passion as an educator,

27
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:25,880
or a passion as someone who's interested in sports,

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,320
or cooking, or in my case, medicine.

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,675
There is work to do in data science in all those fields and many more.

30
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:38,940
What's very important in choosing a career is to have some passion behind it.

31
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,500
If you have a passion for women's basketball,

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,880
and you have a passion for data science in that field,

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,740
you will be a hero, right, because you're going to be able to come in.

34
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,840
And whether that's doing the meta-tagging, or looking

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,430
at statistical information of other sports teams in the past,

36
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,470
you can bring that analysis to bear and help that

37
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,480
sports team perform better or train better,

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,860
be better prepared for that next game in ways that other people can't, right?

39
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,830
I think part of what's hard for us to sort of understand as humans

40
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,180
is there is some very serious limits to what our brain can do.

41
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,690
It can be so easily fooled, right,

42
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,540
like we believe we can win the lottery.

43
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,790
We believe we're going to die in an airplane when the most likely thing to do,

44
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,990
of course, is to die in an automobile accident.

45
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,325
No one gets scared jumping into their car.

46
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:29,270
And so, that capability to go

47
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,440
beyond what humans can think about on their own, to process data,

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,520
and bring new insights to whether,

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,805
it's a basketball game or any other discipline is a very powerful thing,

50
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:44,000
and that can be applied to nearly any endeavor that humans engage in.
