Some people have suggested that when a student is grading other students' homework,

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,950
there might actually be a substantial learning effect.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,115
Recently an experiment was done to figure that out.

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:16,335
Students were randomized into three groups,

5
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:20,415
with each group spending the same amount of time per week.

6
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:23,195
One group did homework only,

7
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:26,340
the second group did homework in peer assessment,

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,880
and the third group simply studied without doing any homework.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,685
The final exam scores of that class were summarized by three boxplots.

10
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:42,085
You can see from the boxplots that the three medians differ somewhat.

11
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:45,230
But the question is whether that is sufficient evidence to

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,235
conclude that the three treatments result in different outcomes.

13
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:54,545
Of course in this case, the null hypothesis of nothing extraordinary is going on,

14
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:58,470
simply means that all groups have the same treatment mean.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,580
Now if we had only two groups,

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,740
then we already know how to attack that problem.

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,955
We would simply use a two-sample t-test.

18
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:12,120
In that case, the t-statistic looks at the difference in the two sample means.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,800
And, compares it to the standard error of the difference.

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,470
What we do in this module is we generalize

21
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,580
this idea to the situation where we have several groups.

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,380
This methodology is called ANOVA.
