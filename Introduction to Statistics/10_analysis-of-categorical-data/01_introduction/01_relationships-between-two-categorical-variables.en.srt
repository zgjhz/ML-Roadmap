1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,150
Categorical data come up

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,800
when observations are grouped into categories
and organized into tables.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,070
We will look at three important statistical
analyses for categorical data.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,870
Tests for goodness of fit, homogeneity, and
independence.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:22,150
This module is about categorical data. To see 
what categorical data are, let's look

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,650
at this big tragedy from 1912,

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,600
when the Titanic sank and more than 1,500

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,200
of the 2,229 people on board died.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,260
The question we can have is, 
whether the chance of survival

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,410
depended on the ticket class. It 
turns out very detailed

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,150
data are available about the Titanic disaster.

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,700
Here's a table that

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,090
shows the number of survivors and
people who died

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,276
for each ticket class, as well as for
the crew. This is a typical example

15
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:59,091
for categorical data. The data 
are given as counts

16
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:04,280
for a fixed number of categories. Typically,

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,090
such data are obtained by grouping. In
this case, the data are tabulated

18
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,900
in what's called a 2 x 4 table.

19
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,780
That's because there are two rows
and four columns.

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,910
Such a table is also called a contingency table,

21
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,410
because it shows the survival counts
for each category of ticket class.

22
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,910
That means, contingent on the ticket class.

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,620
We will look at three problems

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,890
that involve categorical data.

25
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,480
They all use the chi-squared test.
These problems are testing goodness

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,000
of fit, testing homogeneity and
testing independence.
