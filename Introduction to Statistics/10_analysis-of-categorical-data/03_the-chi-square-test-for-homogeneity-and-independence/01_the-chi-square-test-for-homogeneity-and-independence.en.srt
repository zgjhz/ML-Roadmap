1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,495
Here's a different question about colors and M&Ms.

2
00:00:04,495 --> 00:00:08,895
Is the color distribution the same for milk chocolate M&Ms,

3
00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:12,035
peanut M&Ms, and caramel M&Ms?

4
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:13,865
So in this case,

5
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:17,310
we would have to compare several populations.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,815
That is called a test of homogeneity.

7
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:23,440
The null distribution is that

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,490
the color distribution is the same for all of the populations,

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,570
which in this case, are milk, peanut, and caramel.

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,720
The chi-square test of homogeneity assumes that the samples are drawn

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,195
independently for each population, and also independently across the populations.

12
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:43,365
To see how the mechanics of the test work,

13
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:47,620
let's look again at the survival data for the Titanic.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,295
The first thing to note is that we're not sampling from a population.

15
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:57,475
The data we have are not a random sample of the people on board,

16
00:00:57,475 --> 00:01:01,580
rather the data represent the whole population.

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,140
So, this is not the usual setup where we sample from

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,410
a population, but it may still meet the assumption that we draw independently.

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:20,270
The way to think about this is that the chance process resulting in survival or death,

20
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,450
is the result of a sequence of random events that

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,630
occurs when people try to find their way out of the ship,

22
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,915
get into a lifeboat, or have to jump into the water,

23
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:34,160
and whether they are being rescued out of the water in time.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,740
So, we can think about the 325 observations on first-class passengers as

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,250
325 independent draws from

26
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,575
a probability histogram that gives a certain chance for survival.

27
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:50,990
Likewise, the 285 observations about

28
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,270
second-class passengers are drawn from

29
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,475
a probability histogram for second-class passengers,

30
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,170
which may be different.

31
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,460
Now, the null hypothesis says that

32
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,480
the probability of survival is the same for all four probability histograms.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,520
And that's the null hypothesis we're going to test.

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,735
The chi-square test in this situation is quite similar to the one before.

35
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:20,550
That means we compare the observed counts to expected counts.

36
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,725
We already have a table of observed counts.

37
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:27,205
So next, we have to find the table of expected counts.

38
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:32,790
The way this is done is that realizing that under the null hypothesis,

39
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,475
the probability of survival is the same for all four populations.

40
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:43,440
That means we can estimate the probability by simply pooling all the data.

41
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,405
In total, there were 713 survivors among the 2,229 people on board.

42
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:58,295
So, we estimate the probability of survival as 713 over 2,229, which is 32%.

43
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:02,770
Then the expected number of surviving first-class passengers is

44
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:09,295
that 32% times the number of first-class passengers, and that comes out to be 104.

45
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,440
We repeat this calculation for

46
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,025
the other seven categories and that gives us and our table of expected values.

47
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:21,010
Then we compute the chi-square statistic just as before.

48
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,855
That is, we look at the difference between observed and expected, square it,

49
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:30,550
divide it by expected, and sum over all eight cells.

50
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,580
In that case, the chi-square statistic gives us 192.2.

51
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,370
Again, we have to compare this number to

52
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,185
a chi-square distribution but the degrees of freedom in this case, it's different.

53
00:03:43,185 --> 00:03:47,910
The degrees of freedom is given by the number of columns - 1,

54
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,620
times the number of rows - 1.

55
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,260
So, we had four ticket classes,

56
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,770
so we had four columns.

57
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,460
So, 4 - (-3),

58
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,370
and then we had two rows,

59
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,760
2 - 1 = 1,

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,240
so the degrees of freedom is the product of 3 and 1 which is 3.

61
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,770
So then we have to compare the chi-square value of 192.2,

62
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,305
against a chi-square distribution with three degrees of freedom.

63
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:15,520
If you look at the picture,

64
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,620
you see that this 192 is all the way out there and

65
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,310
there's essentially no area to the right so the p-value is 0%,

66
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,470
and that is very strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

67
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,935
So the conclusion would be that the chances of survival depended on the ticket class.

68
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:43,190
Finally, the third application of the chi-square test is testing independence.

69
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,580
As an example, we may ask whether gender being

70
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,795
male or female is related to voting preference.

71
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:52,315
That means voting liberal or conservative.

72
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:55,470
In this case, we have two categorical variables.

73
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,850
One is gender and the other is voting preference.

74
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,415
The null hypothesis is that the two variables are independent.

75
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:08,070
The alternative hypothesis is that there is some kind of association.

76
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:13,175
Again, the chi-square test can be used to test this null hypothesis.

77
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:18,865
We sample data from the population by sampling people at random,

78
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:23,035
we record the outcomes for the two categorical variables,

79
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:26,970
and that gives us columns in a two-by-two table.

80
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,580
It turns out that the chi-square statistic and p-value are

81
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,290
computed exactly as in the case of testing homogeneity.

82
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,845
That means we also used the same way of computing the degrees of freedom.

83
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:41,830
Since the chi-square test works the same way

84
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,070
both for testing independence and testing homogeneity,

85
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,185
it's easy to mix those up.

86
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:52,480
Here's a table that compares what's different between these two cases.

87
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,755
The first difference is in the sampling.

88
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,870
The chi-square test of homogeneity measures

89
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,240
a single categorical variable on

90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,245
several samples that were obtained from several populations.

91
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:08,619
In contrast, for the chi-square test of independence,

92
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:14,510
we have only one sample, but we measure two categorical variables on the sample.

93
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,750
Also, the research questions are different.

94
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,225
The chi-square test of homogeneity tests whether the different groups are homogeneous,

95
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:28,715
which means that they have the same distribution of the categorical variable.

96
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:31,180
In contrast, the chi-square test of

97
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,200
independence checks whether the two categorical variables are independent.
