1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
M&M Candy comes in different colors.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,865
The company that produces M&Ms,

3
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:10,015
actually put the percentages of the various colors on their website.

4
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:14,150
But in 2008, they stopped publishing those data.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,750
Here are the last data that were published in 2008.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,115
It shows the percentages for each of the six colors, blue,

7
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:26,600
orange, green, yellow, red and brown.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,625
So the question is,

9
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,940
whether that's still the distribution of colors today.

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,210
A group of students opened a bag of milk chocolate M&Ms and counted the colors.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,195
And here's the table of the counts which they got.

12
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:43,850
So, we would like to answer the question whether

13
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,305
these counts are consistent with the last published percentages.

14
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:50,660
Or, whether there are sufficient evidence to

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,185
claim that the color distribution is now different.

16
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:57,725
This type of problem is called, a goodness-of-fit test.

17
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,360
The question here is,

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,710
whether the observed data fit the published distribution.

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,490
As always when testing,

20
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,520
we have to think what the null hypothesis is.

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,215
Remember, the null hypothesis means that nothing special is going on.

22
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:15,030
And in that case, that would mean that

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,915
the color distribution is still the same that it was in 2008.

24
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:23,130
The alternative hypothesis would be that the color distribution is different.

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,010
The idea of a goodness-of-fit test is,

26
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,660
to compare the observed counts to

27
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,370
the numbers one would expect if the null hypothesis were true.

28
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,840
In order to do that,

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,180
we need to figure out what the expected number under the null hypothesis would be.

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,060
Now, that's a very simple calculation.

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,735
We have 410 M&Ms in our bag,

32
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:50,760
so under the null hypothesis, we expect 24%,

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,275
which is the percentage given in the table,

34
00:01:53,275 --> 00:02:00,255
times these 410 counts which is 98.4 blue M&Ms.

35
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:02,990
So, now do this for all the other five colors,

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,505
and then we have a table for expected counts.

37
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:09,600
And remember, we also had a table for the observed counts.

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,960
So, next we have to compare these two rows of observed and expected counts,

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,580
and see whether those numbers are compatible with each other.

40
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,170
The way we do that is,

41
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,870
we look at the difference between observed and expected counts,

42
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,705
then we square it to make it non-negative and then we standardize it.

43
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:32,970
And it turns out that,

44
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,635
in order to standardize,

45
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:38,775
here we have to divide by the expected counts.

46
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:46,075
We do that for each category and we sum up these terms of all categories.

47
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:52,135
So, for example, for the blue M&Ms we observed 85,

48
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:56,140
we expected 98.4, and so,

49
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,520
we take the difference of these two,

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,500
square it and divide by expected.

51
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,235
We do this for all six colors and

52
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:10,780
the statistic, which is called a chi-square statistic, is then 8.57.

53
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,960
If the value of that chi-square statistic is large,

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,280
that means there's a big discrepancy between observed and expected counts.

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,825
And that's evidence against the null hypothesis.

56
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:26,755
On the other hand, if the chi-square statistic is small,

57
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:31,165
that means that the observed and expected counts are close to each other.

58
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,930
Next, we compute a P-value,

59
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,815
that means we have to assess how large that

60
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:42,120
8.57 is when compared to an appropriate null distribution.

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,615
In this case, it turns out the null distribution is called the chi-square distribution.

62
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:49,580
Which comes with the degrees of freedom,

63
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,285
and the degrees of freedom is the number of categories minus one.

64
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:55,940
So, in this case we have six colors,

65
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,615
so the degrees of freedom is five.

66
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:00,190
On the right-hand side,

67
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,475
you see the curve for the chi-square distribution with five degrees of freedom.

68
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:10,640
And our value of the chi-square statistic is 8.57, so,

69
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,610
the P-value is the area to the right of that,

70
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,075
which turns out to be 12.7%.

71
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:18,800
So, the conclusion here is that,

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,920
there's not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

73
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,430
The assumption of the chi-square test is that

74
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,980
the observed data are counts that were

75
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,505
obtained by drawing independently from a population.

76
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:39,285
It's plausible that filling a bag of M&Ms roughly corresponds to this process.

77
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,940
It's an interesting fact,

78
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,345
the blue M&Ms were not introduced until 1995.

79
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:48,600
In the beginning, some people suspected that there were

80
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,125
fewer blue M&Ms in the bag than advertised.

81
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,130
Of course we can also test that.

82
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,440
This is a case which we looked at before,

83
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,995
because if we are just interested in one category,

84
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:04,935
then we can simply use a z-test.

85
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:09,970
So, the chi-square test is in a sense a generalization of the z-test,

86
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,680
if you want to examine several categories.
