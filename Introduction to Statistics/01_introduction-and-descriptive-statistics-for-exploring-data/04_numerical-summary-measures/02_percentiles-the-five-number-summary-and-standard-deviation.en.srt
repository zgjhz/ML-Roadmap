1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,470
Remember when we talked about graphical
summaries, we talked about the boxplot.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,880
The boxplot shows five
numbers about the data.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,668
The smallest number,
which is given on the lower whisker,

4
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:20,590
the 1st quartile up here, the median,
the 3rd quartile, and the largest number.

5
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:27,942
The distance between the 3rd quartile and

6
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:32,830
the 1st quartile tells you how
much the data is spread out.

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,570
This has a special name,
it's called the interquartile range.

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,900
When it comes to measuring
spread in the data,

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,250
it's more common to use a different
measure, namely the standard deviation.

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,540
You've probably seen the notation x bar,
which stands for

11
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,660
the average of a list of numbers.

12
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,620
Let's call them x1 to xn.

13
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,450
Here's the formula for
the standard deviation of these numbers.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,400
It's not that important to remember
the formula, since calculators and

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,090
computers can compute it for you.

16
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,970
But let's just have a look what
the interpretation of that formula is.

17
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,220
What the standard deviation does
is it looks at the difference

18
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,350
of each number from its average,
squares the difference,

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,760
and then looks at the average
of those squared differences.

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,550
And finally, it takes the square root.

21
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:40,861
Sometimes, you see a formula that has
n-1 instead of n in the denominator.

22
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:44,860
Both of these formulas
work roughly equally well.

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,000
The mean and the standard deviation
are often used to summarize data.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,500
The first one gives you
a measure of center, and

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,310
the second one gives a measure of spread.

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,710
Both can be sensitive to a few large or

27
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,740
small data,
just as we saw in the example before.

28
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,775
So if you're worried about that, for
example, if the histogram is very skewed,

29
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:13,490
then it may be better to use
the median and the interquartile range.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,580
Of course, one problem is that many
people don't know what the median and

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,410
the interquartile range is.

32
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,080
So you may have to explain that.
