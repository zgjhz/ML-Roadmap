1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
So, let's talk about numerical summary measures.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,220
If we want to summarize data using just one number,

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,470
then, we use the mean or the median.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,000
So, everybody knows the mean which is simply the average.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,475
The median is the number where half the data are larger and half are smaller.

6
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:22,305
So, it is in some way, a midpoint.

7
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:26,355
Let's look at that histogram which shows

8
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:31,205
annual household incomes in the United States in 2010.

9
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:34,000
Remember that in the histogram,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,680
area corresponds to percentage.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,900
So, we can find the median by looking at the point where half of the area is below,

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,240
and half of the area is above.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,555
So, here it is marked that the median is at about $50,000.

14
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:57,740
And we can see that roughly half the area of the histogram is below $50,000,

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,525
and half the area of the histogram is above $50,000.

16
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:06,960
So, now we know that both the mean and the median summarize the data,

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,120
and the question is which one should we use?

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,940
It turns out that if the histogram is symmetric,

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,615
then the mean and the median are actually the same.

20
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:22,450
This histogram shows 100 of the first measurements that were made of the speed of light.

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,820
The numbers on the horizontal axis show the speed measured

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,075
after subtracting of 299,000 kilometers per second.

23
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:38,350
We see that this histogram is roughly symmetric around this axis.

24
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,400
Other data that result in symmetric histograms would be,

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,780
for example, heights and weights of people.

26
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,065
But when we look at the histogram of annual household incomes,

27
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:53,480
we see that the histogram is far from symmetric.

28
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,250
A histogram like this where the right side is much

29
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,535
longer than the left side is called skewed to the right.

30
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:10,650
In that case, the mean can be much larger than the median.

31
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,180
In fact, for the annual household incomes,

32
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,095
the mean household income is about $67,000.

33
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:22,095
Whereas, we saw that the median is $50,000.

34
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:24,815
For such a skewed histogram,

35
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:27,400
it is better to use the median.

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,410
Let's look at this hypothetical example,

37
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,395
where we look at 10 homes and we know that the median sales price is $1 million.

38
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:40,310
Then, we know that five homes sold for $1 million or more,

39
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,470
and five homes sold for less than $1 million.

40
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,090
On the other hand, if we are told that the average sales price is $1 million,

41
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,800
then, it's not really clear what that means.

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
If the average is $1 million, then,

43
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,360
we know that the sum of the 10 sales prices is $10 million.

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:08,540
Now, let's assume that one house sold for $8 million.

45
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,600
Then, we know that the total sales prices for the other nine houses must be $2 million.

46
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,120
The average sales price of

47
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,785
the other 9 homes is those $2 million divided by 9,

48
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:28,900
and that's about $200,000.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,420
So, if we think that the average sales price of

50
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,890
$1 million means that most houses sold for roughly $1 million,

51
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,330
then we are very wrong in this case.

52
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:49,960
So, the lesson here is that if the histogram is very skewed,

53
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,340
as is the case for incomes and house prices,

54
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,695
then, knowing the average doesn't really tell you much.

55
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,770
It's much better to use the median in those cases.

56
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,140
Let's go back to the histogram of annual household incomes.

57
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:16,015
It says that the top 10% reported an income of $135,000,

58
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:22,975
that means that 90% of households had incomes of less than 135,000,

59
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:27,465
and 10% had incomes above $135,000.

60
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:31,590
This point is called a 90th percentile.

61
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:40,900
Furthermore, it says that the top 25% had household incomes above $85,000.

62
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:49,740
This would be the 75th percentile because 75% of households have incomes below that.

63
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,105
The 75th percentile is also called the third quartile,

64
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:59,700
that comes from the fact that if one divides the histogram in four equal parts,

65
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,685
then one gets the 25th percentile,

66
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:06,830
the 50th percentile, and the 75th percentile.

67
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,790
So, the 50th percentile is then the second quartile,

68
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,330
and we already learned another name for that which is the median,

69
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,680
and the 25th percentile is the first quartile.
