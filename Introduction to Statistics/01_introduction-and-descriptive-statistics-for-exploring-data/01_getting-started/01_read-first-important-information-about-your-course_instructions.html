  We are excited to have you join us in this course that introduces the fundamental concepts of statistics. This course will teach you statistical thinking concepts that are essential for learning from data and communicating insights. By the end of this course, you should be able to perform exploratory analysis, understand the key principles of sampling, and select appropriate tests of significance for multiple concepts. You will gain the foundational skills that prepare you to pursue more advanced topics in statistical thinking and machine learning.
