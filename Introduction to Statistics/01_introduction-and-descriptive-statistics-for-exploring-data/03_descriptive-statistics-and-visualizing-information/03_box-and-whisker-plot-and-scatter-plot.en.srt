1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
I'm sure you've seen a bar graph and a histogram before.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,565
The next one may be new.

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:07,175
It's called the boxplot,

4
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:10,365
sometimes it's also called the box-and-whisker plot.

5
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:16,250
The idea is that it visualizes five key numbers of the data.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,475
In this example, we look at fuel consumption of 32 cars,

7
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:22,530
it's given in miles per gallon.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,950
The lower whisker which is the number here,

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,160
shows the smallest number in the data.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,495
So, we see it's roughly 10 miles per gallon.

11
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:36,060
The upper whisker here shows the largest number

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,980
in the data which may be around 35 miles per gallon.

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,830
And then there are three more numbers;

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,950
we have the median,

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,640
that's the number where half of the data are smaller and half are larger,

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,205
so this might be around 19 miles per gallon,

17
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:59,475
and there's the first quartile, which is this number here, around 15 miles per gallon.

18
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:04,780
That's the number where a quarter of the data are smaller and three-quarters are larger.

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,530
And finally, there's the third quartile, which is this number which

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,480
gives you the point where three quarters of

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,165
the data are smaller and one quarter are larger.

22
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:19,120
The boxplot has less information than a histogram

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,185
because it only shows five numbers of the data.

24
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:27,080
But in turn it takes up less space, and so one can use it to

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,160
compare several datasets by putting them into the same graphic.

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,060
The display below shows the same data that we had on the previous slide.

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,240
But now the data are divided up into

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,425
three groups depending on the number of cylinders of each car.

29
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:45,305
Each group gets its own box plot.

30
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:49,870
By putting all three boxplots in one graphic, we see that

31
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,660
the miles per gallon are larger for cars that have fewer cylinders.

32
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,630
A graphic like this is difficult to make with histograms.

33
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,640
Also, keep in mind that the histogram depends on

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,175
the choice of the intervals that we select for the blocks.

35
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:08,680
We don't have to deal with that when we use boxplots.

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,395
This graphic is an example of the principle of small multiples.

37
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:15,795
We will talk about this later.

38
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:21,785
Finally, let's look at data that consists of not just one number but two,

39
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:24,865
that is the data come as pairs.

40
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:31,225
Those data are typically plotted in a coordinate system which is called a scatter plot.

41
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:38,005
The example here shows the years of education and the salaries for a number of people.

42
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:41,725
For example, this person may have

43
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:47,910
about 12 years of education and an income of roughly $15,000.

44
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,885
The scatter plot is very useful to visualize the relationship between two variables.

45
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:58,500
For example we see that as education increases,

46
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,625
income tends to go up.

47
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,370
And moreover, we see that for many years of

48
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,370
education, there seems to be a steep increase in income.
