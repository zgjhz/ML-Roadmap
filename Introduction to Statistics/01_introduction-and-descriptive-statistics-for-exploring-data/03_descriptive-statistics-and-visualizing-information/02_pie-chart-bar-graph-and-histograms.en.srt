1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,165
There are two ways to summarize data.

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:10,170
One can either use numerical summaries or one can summarize the data using pictures.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,050
For communicating information, it's usually best to use a graphical summary,

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,440
and that's because people prefer to look at pictures rather than at numbers.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,910
Now there are many ways to visualize data.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,640
Which one to choose will depend on

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,860
the nature of the data and the goal of the visualization.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,760
And we will look at some examples now.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,735
First, let's look at a case where the data are qualitative.

10
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:41,635
That is, the data are not numbers but categories such as colors.

11
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:46,555
In that case, we would use a pie chart or a dot plot.

12
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:49,480
On the left, there's a pie chart that shows

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,390
the geographic origin of students at a university on the west coast.

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,840
The idea is that each slice of the pie

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,820
is sliced according to the corresponding percentage.

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,820
The right side shows the dot plot of the same data.

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,605
The idea is that each horizontal line corresponds to one category.

18
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:15,490
The position of the dot corresponds to the percentage.

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,695
For example, if we look at Oregon,

20
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:24,190
this dot corresponds roughly to 20 percent.

21
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,495
Each of the two displays has some advantages and disadvantages.

22
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:33,755
For example, if we want to compare two categories,

23
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:36,640
it's easier to do that in the dot plot.

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,980
If we look at the proportion of

25
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,875
international students and the proportion of students from other US states,

26
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:49,350
then it's very difficult to see which one is bigger,

27
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,945
whereas it's very easy to see that in the dot plot

28
00:01:53,945 --> 00:02:00,575
because it's much easier to judge the position on a horizontal line.

29
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:02,795
On the other hand,

30
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:10,300
the pie chart makes it easier to see what percentage of the total a category represents.

31
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,145
For example, if we look at Oregon,

32
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:18,795
then we see that this is roughly a little bit less than a quarter of the total pie.

33
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:22,900
And this would be hard to see in the dot plot because we first

34
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,255
would have to look down on the horizontal axis to see what's going on.

35
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:30,900
Now, when the data themselves are quantitative, that is,

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,765
they are numbers, then the convention is to put the data on the number line.

37
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:40,630
The reason for this is that the ordering in

38
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,470
the distance between the numbers conveys important information.

39
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,590
The standard graph for displaying such data is the bar graph.

40
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,865
It's essentially a dot plot put on its side.

41
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:55,650
In this example, it shows the number of

42
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,150
assignments that were completed by 22 students in a class.

43
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,915
The histogram is very similar to a bar graph,

44
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:07,380
but it allows to use blocks which have different width.

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,065
For example, this histogram shows the ages of a number of people.

46
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:19,005
The key point here is that the areas of the blocks are proportional to frequency.

47
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:23,580
This means that the total area corresponds to 100 percent.

48
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,835
For example, if were interested in figuring out

49
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:31,525
what percentage of people fall in the age group from 60-80,

50
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:35,730
then we are interested in the area of this block.

51
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,170
Now, just looking at that picture,

52
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:44,530
we see that this area is probably around one-seventh of the total area.

53
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,440
And so, we can conclude that roughly 20 percent of

54
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,220
the people fall into the range from 60-80.

55
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,665
So the percentage falling into a block can be figured out without using a vertical scale,

56
00:03:56,665 --> 00:04:01,230
just using the fact that the total area has to be 100 percent.

57
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,260
Now, sometimes, it is useful to have a vertical scale.

58
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,080
It's also called the density scale.

59
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,745
And the reason for that is simply that the area of the block corresponds to a percentage,

60
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:16,010
and the area is computed by width times height.

61
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,650
And since the width is given in years,

62
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:24,675
the unit for the height needs to be percent per year in order for the units to work out.

63
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:29,445
There are two kinds of information one can get out of a histogram.

64
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:33,085
The first one is what's called density,

65
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,570
which essentially means crowding.

66
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,815
The height of the bar tells how many subjects there

67
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:42,120
are for one unit on the horizontal scale.

68
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,255
For example, if we look at the highest point in the histogram,

69
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:50,400
which is around here,

70
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,895
this corresponds to people of age 19.

71
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,610
And looking at the vertical axis,

72
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,580
we see that there are about four percent of all people in that age.

73
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,100
In contrast, if we look at the block between 60 and 80,

74
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,500
we see that the height of the block is maybe 0.007.

75
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,320
That means about 0.7 percent of

76
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:27,950
the subjects fall under each one year group in that age range.

77
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,555
The second piece of

78
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:41,150
information one can get from the histogram is to compute percentages.

79
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,025
Remember the rule which says the area corresponds to a percentage.

80
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:50,200
And the area of a block is given by height times width.

81
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,160
So, for example, if we want to figure out

82
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,385
what percentage of people fall in the age range between 60 and 80,

83
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:03,100
then the computation that we would make is,

84
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,805
we would look at the width of the box,

85
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:07,875
which is 20 years,

86
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,410
multiplied by the height,

87
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,495
which is 0.7 percent per year.

88
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:20,085
And we would find that they are 14 percent of subjects falling in that range.

89
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:22,500
As we've seen before,

90
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,135
there is another way to figure this one out.

91
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:31,515
We can eyeball that this area comprises roughly one-seventh of the total area.

92
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:36,710
So, roughly one-seventh of the subjects fall in that range.
