00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,245
In our first module,

2
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:04,455
we will look at descriptive statistics.

3
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:08,620
That is, ways to summarize data with numbers and graphs.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,855
In particular, we will look at some important principles for visualizing information.

5
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:19,060
This is important because most people prefer to look at figures, rather than at numbers.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,500
So, it's best to communicate information with figures whenever possible.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,260
Let's first look at an example that shows why descriptive statistics are so useful.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:35,520
In January 1986, the space shuttle Challenger broke apart shortly after liftoff.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,700
This accident was caused by a part that was not designed to

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,140
fly at the unusually cold temperature of 29 degrees at launch.

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,935
This was actually discussed by the engineers before the launch.

12
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:51,200
But let's look at the data.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Here is a list of the launch temperatures for the first 25 shuttle missions.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,880
And if you look at this long list of numbers,

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,330
it's kind of difficult to see what's going on.

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,170
However, if we make a simpler graphic like this one,

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,345
we see immediately that the temperature of

18
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:17,115
29 degrees at launch day is really far below all the other temperatures.

19
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:22,275
So, this makes clear why a simple graphic can be very useful.

20
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:26,000
So, while descriptive statistics has a number of uses,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,225
the two most important functions are to communicate information,

22
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:32,880
and to support reasoning about the data.

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,985
Also, when the data are really large,

24
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:39,750
then it becomes essential to use summaries because there's

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,050
simply no other way to look at the data or to use the data.
