00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,790
The purpose of a statistical analysis is

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,725
typically to compare the observed data to some kind of reference.

3
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:12,800
Therefore, it's very useful to provide context in graphical displays.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,820
There's a nice explanation of this in the book

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,260
'The Visual Display of Quantitative Information' by Edward Tufte.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:27,300
One way to provide context in the graphic is by using the principle of small multiples.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,055
We've already seen that the boxplot is very useful for this.

8
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:35,650
This graphic shows the temperatures that were

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,365
recorded at a weather station over 50 years.

10
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:43,020
It shows a boxplot for each month.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,405
For example, this is the boxplot for January.

12
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:52,310
So it contains the data for the 50 recordings of January.

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:57,990
This display allows to compare how the temperatures vary throughout the year.

14
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,390
The reason why the principle of small multiples works well is because

15
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,755
the human brain is very good at decoding the information in these pictures.

16
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:14,125
Here's another example showing small multiples.

17
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:22,180
It shows the monthly unemployment rates for each state from January 1976 to April 2009.

18
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,855
Each plot is a time series plot.

19
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:27,120
That means on the horizontal axis,

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,310
we have time from 1976-2009,

21
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,595
and under vertical axis,

22
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,365
we have the unemployment rate.

23
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:41,715
The line that's given in each graph shows how the unemployment rate changes over time.

24
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:44,825
Moreover, there is an orange band which shows

25
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:49,050
a normal unemployment rate of between 4 and 6 percent.

26
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,090
By looking at these small multiples,

27
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,620
one sees immediately that there's a sharp increase in

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,600
the unemployment rate during

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,880
the financial crisis in states such as California and Michigan,

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,720
whereas things are not so bad in states such as Montana or South Dakota.
