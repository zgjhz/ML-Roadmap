In our first module, we will look at descriptive statistics. That is, ways to summarize data with numbers and graphs. In particular, we will look at some important principles for visualizing information. This is important because most people prefer to look at figures, rather than at numbers. So, it's best to communicate information with figures whenever possible. Let's first look at an example that shows why descriptive statistics are so useful. In January 1986, the space shuttle Challenger broke apart shortly after liftoff. This accident was caused by a part that was not designed to fly at the unusually cold temperature of 29 degrees at launch. This was actually discussed by the engineers before the launch. But let's look at the data. Here is a list of the launch temperatures for the first 25 shuttle missions. And if you look at this long list of numbers, it's kind of difficult to see what's going on. However, if we make a simpler graphic like this one, we see immediately that the temperature of 29 degrees at launch day is really far below all the other temperatures. So, this makes clear why a simple graphic can be very useful. So, while descriptive statistics has a number of uses, the two most important functions are to communicate information, and to support reasoning about the data. Also, when the data are really large, then it becomes essential to use summaries because there's simply no other way to look at the data or to use the data.
