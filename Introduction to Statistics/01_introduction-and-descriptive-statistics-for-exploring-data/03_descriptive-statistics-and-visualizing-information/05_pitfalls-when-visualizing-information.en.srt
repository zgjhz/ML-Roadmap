00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
Modern software provides a lot of freedom to design one's own graphics.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,540
There is a temptation to produce graphics that is flashy,

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,855
but often times that results actually in a poor outcome.

4
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:18,435
This is a graphic that shows annual donations to three universities.

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,990
Keep in mind that we are really comparing three numbers here.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,605
There is a number for Harvard which is 683 million,

7
00:00:26,605 --> 00:00:28,590
a number for Stanford which is

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,785
469 million, and a number for Columbia which is 359 million.

9
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:39,265
The graphic looks really interesting because it has three-dimensional bars,

10
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:41,910
but it is actually quite difficult to read.

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,765
One reason for that is because we are looking at three-dimensional blocks.

12
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:50,230
So we are thinking we have to visualize

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,520
volume when in fact we are just comparing heights,

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,020
but comparing heights is itself quite

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,005
difficult because you are seeing a perspective plot here.

16
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:06,625
The base of the three blocks is at different heights due to the perspective plot.

17
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,560
Now to help you see what's going on,

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,485
there are grid-lines in the background which

19
00:01:13,485 --> 00:01:18,405
allow you to refer the height of the block to the corresponding number.

20
00:01:18,405 --> 00:01:20,434
But as a consequence,

21
00:01:20,434 --> 00:01:25,530
it is really quite difficult to compare these three numbers.

22
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,685
It would have been much better to put these three numbers in a dot plot,

23
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:32,665
which makes it much easier to compare them.

24
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:34,960
As another fun example,

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,970
look at the Gettysburg PowerPoint presentation by Peter Norvig,

26
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,360
Peter envisions what may have happened had

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,600
Abe Lincoln fallen into the trap of using flashy graphics.
