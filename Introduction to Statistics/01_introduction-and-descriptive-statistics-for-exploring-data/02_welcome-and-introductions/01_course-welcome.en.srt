1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,150
The amount of information and

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,800
data that are becoming available
to us is growing exponentially.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,070
As the amount of available data grows,
so is our need to understand it.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,870
Statistics is the science of learning
from data. This course will help you to

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:22,150
develop the skills you need to analyze
data and to communicate your findings.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,650
There won't be many
formulas in the course.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,600
Rather, we will develop the key
ideas of statistical thinking

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,370
that are essential for learning from data.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,260
When you take this course, it is helpful
if you have access to a spreadsheet,

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,410
a software package, or website that
provides basic statistical functions,

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,150
such as areas under the normal curve.

12
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,700
But proficiency in
a programming language is not

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,710
necessary to master the contents and
to complete the course.

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,276
We will discuss the main tools for
descriptive statistics which are essential

15
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:59,091
for exploring data, with an emphasis
on visualizing information.

16
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:04,280
We will explain the important ideas about
sampling and conducting experiments.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,090
Then we will look over some
important rules of probability and

18
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,900
discuss normal approximation and
the central limit theorem.

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,780
We will show you the important concepts
and pitfalls of regression and

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,570
how to do inference with confidence
intervals and tests of hypotheses.

21
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,410
You will learn the key ideas about
computer-intensive inference

22
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,910
with the Monte Carlo method and
the Bootstrap.

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,620
We will show you how to
analyze categorical data and

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,870
discuss one-way analysis of variance.

25
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,480
Finally, we will look at reproducibility,
data snooping and

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,530
the multiple testing fallacy and
how to account for multiple comparisons.

27
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,220
These issues have become particularly
important in the era of big data.

28
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,870
Broadly, there are three main reasons
why statistical literacy is essential

29
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,700
in data science.

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,720
First, it provides the skills to assess
whether the data are sufficient to

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,090
answer the questions at hand.

32
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,500
Second, it establishes a rigorous
framework for quantifying uncertainty.

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,560
And finally, it provides techniques for

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,670
effectively communicating
the findings of your analyses.

35
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,250
This course equips you with important
tools in all of these areas.

36
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,070
It is the statistical foundation on which
the recent exciting advances in machine

37
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,600
learning are built.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,230
I hope you will enjoy the course.
