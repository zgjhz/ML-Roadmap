00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Hello, my name is Guenther Walther and I would

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,830
like to come you to the introductory statistics course.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,550
I'm a professor in the Department of Statistics at

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,150
Stanford University where I teach and do research.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,430
I regularly teach a variety of classes from the introductory level for freshmen,

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,995
all the way to Ph.D. level classes.

7
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:26,035
I've been involved in developing the data science track in our Master of Science program,

8
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:28,780
which the Department of Statistics runs jointly with

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,395
the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering.

10
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:35,830
Together with some of my colleagues in the statistics department,

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,300
I've also helped to create

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,425
a data science course that is accessible to all students at Stanford,

13
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:46,620
which incorporates many topics that you will find in this introductory statistics course.

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,450
Research-wise, I have worked in a range of

15
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,270
areas from investigating puzzling behavior in solar neutrinos,

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,840
to extracting information from many measurements of

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,140
single cells in high-throughput biological experiments,

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,260
to developing new statistical methodology.

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,840
One thing that I noticed when working in

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,680
these diverse areas is that statistical questions come up everywhere,

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,250
and that having a good grasp of the key ideas

22
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,770
of statistical thinking can make a big difference.
