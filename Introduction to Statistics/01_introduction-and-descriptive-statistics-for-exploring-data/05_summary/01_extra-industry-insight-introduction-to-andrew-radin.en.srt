1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,435
So my name is Andrew Radin.

2
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:03,890
I'm the CEO and co-founder of twoXAR,

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,385
and we are an artificial intelligence-based drug discovery company.

4
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:10,095
By training, I'm a computer scientist.

5
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:13,160
I did a bunch of startups prior to this.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,895
All in consumer space,

7
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:16,100
all, you know, either large,

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,820
computer, large data science,

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,145
I've worked on the systems that power nations, telephone calls,

10
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:23,835
I've built large scale advertising networks that have

11
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:27,090
served billions of ads and hit tens of millions of people,

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,465
I've built large scale video games on Facebook, all these sorts of things.

13
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:32,240
And all these projects,

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,295
while I was doing that as an entrepreneur,

15
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:36,545
I kind of had a second life if you will,

16
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:38,450
working on social causes.

17
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,550
So, when I was a child,

18
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,340
my grandmother started a homeless shelter with some of her friends,

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,140
which I've been involved with all the way to today as an adult.

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,665
My wife and I have traveled to third world countries and helped people in need.

21
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:55,590
And all this work had been very separate.

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,030
And a number of years ago, I thought,

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,575
I'd like to bring those things together in some way.

24
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:04,490
I'm very interested in helping the homeless in some meaningful way,

25
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,235
and about that time,

26
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:10,310
one of the largest, if not the largest homeless encampment in the United States,

27
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,330
was close to my home, it's called The Jungle in San Jose.

28
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,630
And I was thinking,

29
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,730
I really should get involved and make a big impact.

30
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,140
And my wife, a very wise woman,

31
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,360
said, that's a social issue,

32
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,800
that's not where your skills can be best applied.

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,310
As a computer scientist, maybe you should think about how you can

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,885
use data science to make a more meaningful impact in the world.

35
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:36,120
And so long story short, that's how I ended up at Stanford,

36
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,260
learning about how to use computer science specifically in the field of medicine.

37
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,165
And that got me to where I am today.

38
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:46,075
Through the SCPD program at Stanford,

39
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:49,580
there is a course offered in the bioinformatics track.

40
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,980
And what that course is about,

41
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,530
is learning how other people have used data science and

42
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,140
computer science to do some sort of medical discovery,

43
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,405
or move the field forward in some way.

44
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,910
And in that course, at least when I took it,

45
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,630
you learn a lot about what other people had done,

46
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,935
methods they used, techniques they used,

47
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:07,605
to come up with some discovery.

48
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:11,500
And one of the guest lecturers was given by Marina Sirota,

49
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,610
she's a professor now at UCSF.

50
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,600
And she was talking about her work in using gene expression, micro-arrays,

51
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,490
and differential expression between drug signatures with those who had,

52
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,070
and didn't have a disease,

53
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,590
to figure out which new medications could be potentially effective.

54
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,345
And I just thought her work was absolutely fascinating,

55
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:32,760
because it came on the heels of another lecture,

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,430
where we were talking about this concept of inter-group genomics,

57
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,680
which is pulling in data from lots of different instrumentation,

58
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,610
lots of different sort of views, if you will,

59
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,235
about a particular problem,

60
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:44,910
and how you can incorporate

61
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,490
those different sort of datasets to figure out what's real, and what's a false positive.

62
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,990
And all of this just kind of clicked together in my head with

63
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,710
some work I'd done in a couple of previous startups,

64
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,170
where I was thinking about this larger idea of

65
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,515
incorporating this wide diversity of datasets,

66
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:02,220
and putting together a mechanism which helped explore

67
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,865
those data sets and figure out what's real and what's not.

68
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:08,540
Right? And so that was the genesis of my project in that course,

69
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,000
and then ultimately the technology behind the company today.
