1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
This module looks at confidence intervals.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,450
We'll discuss the interpretation and how to construct

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,535
confidence intervals in some standard situations.

4
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:13,100
It's important to have a solid grasp on these concepts because

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,435
most statistic analyses provide some kind of confidence interval.

6
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:21,760
Let's look again at the US Presidential approval ratings.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,340
There are about 140 million likely voters.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,280
And let's suppose for a minute that 60% of

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,910
them approve of the way the president is handling his job.

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,480
Now we do a poll.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,020
Let's say, we poll 1,000 of them.

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:42,040
The approval percentage we get in the poll should be somewhat similar to 60%,

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,100
but it will be off a little bit.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,930
How much will it be off?

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,430
Well, we already know that

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,315
the sample percentage is likely off by about one standard error.

17
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:57,750
Oftentimes, one would like to have a statement that is somewhat more precise.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,905
This is done by a confidence interval.

19
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:04,680
We already know that according to the central limit theorem,

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,620
the sample percentage follows the normal curve with expected value equal to mu equal

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,720
the population percentage and standard error equal to

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,645
the population standard deviation sigma divided by square root sample size.

23
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:27,770
In this case, sigma turns out to be 0.49.

24
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:34,595
To compute that, recall that we are looking at the case where we are counting things.

25
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:38,575
Namely, we are counting voters who approve of the president.

26
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:42,250
So, we introduce labels where each voter who

27
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,175
approves gets a 1 and every other voter gets a 0.

28
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:48,480
And there are 140 million voters.

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,525
So, we end up with 140 million labels.

30
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:56,410
And from that, we can compute the standard deviation sigma as 0.48.

31
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:02,535
So, what this means is that there is a population percentage mu,

32
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:04,760
which is 60%.

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,230
And then, if we sample 1,000 voters,

34
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,800
the sample percentage will follow the normal curve.

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,285
And the empirical rule says,

36
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:17,110
if we go two standard errors each way,

37
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,685
then there's a 95% chance

38
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:23,595
that the sample percentage will be somewhere in that range.

39
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:27,990
So, we know that there's a 95% chance that

40
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,360
the sample percentage is

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,375
no more than two standard errors away from the population percentage mu.

42
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,660
But saying that the sample percentage is

43
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,500
no more than two standard errors away from the population percentage mu is the

44
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,365
same as saying that

45
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,590
the population percentage mu is

46
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,360
no more than two standard errors away from the sample percentage.

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,445
What this means is,

48
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:55,350
we can take our sample percentage, for example,

49
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,505
it may turn out to be 58%,

50
00:02:57,505 --> 00:03:00,865
and then we go two standard errors in each direction.

51
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:06,245
And that gives us a range of plausible values for the population percentage.

52
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:08,945
Remember, when we do a poll,

53
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:11,455
we do not know the population percentage.

54
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:16,025
The whole idea is to take a sample and get a sample percentage.

55
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:20,810
And hopefully, the population percentage will be close to the sample percentage.

56
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,500
So, what we do is,

57
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,190
we take the sample percentage of 58%,

58
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,725
go two standard errors in each direction,

59
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:32,875
which takes us to 54.8% and 61.2%.

60
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,195
And the interval between these two numbers is called

61
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:41,610
a 95% confidence interval for the unknown population percentage.

62
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,205
So, why is this called a confidence interval?

63
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,705
Where does the name confidence come from?

64
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:50,700
And why don't we simply say probability?

65
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,355
Well, the population percentage mu is a fixed number.

66
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:59,790
And that number is either inside the interval or outside the interval.

67
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,950
So once we write down the confidence interval,

68
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,055
there are no more chances involved.

69
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:08,230
And for that reason, we talk about confidence.

70
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,595
The randomness in this procedure comes really through the sampling.

71
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:15,240
If we sampled another 1,000 voters,

72
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,805
we will get a slightly different interval.

73
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:23,020
So, the interpretation of a 95% confidence interval is,

74
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,550
that if we do many polls and for each poll we do a confidence interval,

75
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,340
then 95% of these intervals trap the population percentage and therefore,

76
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,965
5% percent will miss it.

77
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:37,620
The number 95% is called the

78
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,680
confidence level that comes with a confidence interval.

79
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,775
Here's a picture that explains the situation.

80
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:49,170
There are some population percentage mu.

81
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,960
Let's say it's 60%.

82
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,875
And then we take a sample of size 1,000,

83
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,770
and we compute a confidence interval.

84
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,380
For example, that confidence interval might be from

85
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,570
55% down here to 65% up here.

86
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,640
And you see, in this case,

87
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,535
the confidence interval traps the population percentage mu.

88
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:13,910
Then, next week, Gallup might do another poll,

89
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,775
and it comes up with another confidence interval.

90
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:20,130
And that might run from here to there.

91
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,290
And somebody else might do a third confidence interval,

92
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,555
and it may be from here to here.

93
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:32,225
And another poll may result in a confidence interval from here to here.

94
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:36,130
And now you see, this one misses the population percentage.

95
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,630
So, among this large number of 95% confidence intervals,

96
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,780
most cover the population percentage,

97
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,945
but some don't, like this one will not and this one will not.

98
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:54,425
The way a confidence interval is reported is oftentimes something like,

99
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:58,380
"I'm 95% confident that the President's approval rating is

100
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,825
between 54.8% and 61.2%."

101
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:07,610
And the interpretation of this is that 95% of the time,

102
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,665
I'm correct when making such a statement,

103
00:06:09,665 --> 00:06:12,260
and 5% of the time, I may be wrong.

104
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,300
So, keep in mind that the randomness is in

105
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,060
the sampling and not in the population percentage.
