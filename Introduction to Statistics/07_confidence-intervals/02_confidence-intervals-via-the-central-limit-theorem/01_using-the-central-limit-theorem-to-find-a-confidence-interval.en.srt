00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,690
The idea of a confidence interval is that it gives a range

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,175
of plausible values for a population parameter which we call mu.

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:14,830
Usually, a confidence interval is constructed around an estimate for mu,

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,505
which oftentimes is some form of an average.

5
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:20,930
Let's look at some examples.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,735
In the first example,

7
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:26,210
the population parameter mu we're interested in is

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,380
the approval percentage among all 140 million likely voters.

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,590
As an estimate, we use the approval percentage among the voters in our sample.

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,975
This percentage is an average in

11
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:43,125
our usual accounting schemes where we have 0 and 1 labels.

12
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:47,460
As another example, suppose we want to measure the speed of light.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,410
In that case, our estimate would be the average of, say, 30 measurements.

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,905
A key point now is that if we use averages,

15
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,910
then we know that the central limit theorem applies.

16
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,340
Therefore, we have a very simple form for the confidence interval,

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:10,485
which is simply the estimate plus minus a z-value times the standard error.

18
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:14,855
And that z-value simply comes from the normal approximation.

19
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:17,300
Which z-value should we take?

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,825
Well, that depends on the desired confidence level.

21
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:25,165
For example, if we would like to have a 95% confidence level,

22
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:28,335
then we get z = 1.96.

23
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:31,990
That comes from normal approximation where we look at

24
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:38,140
the value of the z such that 95% lies in the middle.

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,960
That value of z is 1.96 or,

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,130
oftentimes, we simply use 2.

27
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,360
On the other hand, if we were interested in a 90% confidence level,

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,385
then we would find z = 1.65.

29
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:55,220
And for a 99% confidence level,

30
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,420
we would get z = 2.58.

31
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,825
The third number which we have to write down for our confidence interval is the SE.

32
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,785
That's the standard error of the estimate.

33
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:10,810
If the estimate is an average, for example,

34
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,535
or a percentage, then we know that by the square root law,

35
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:18,570
the standard error is sigma over square root sample size,

36
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,505
where sigma is the standard deviation of the population.

37
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:26,220
So, now we have a small problem because we need to know sigma,

38
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,805
but we don't because sigma is

39
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:35,300
the standard deviation of the population and we don't know what the population is.

40
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:41,170
A way out of this is to simply estimate sigma from the sample.

41
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,400
That is, we use

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,480
a sample standard deviation in place of the population standard deviation.

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,360
That's a very simple idea.

44
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,960
And we will see later that this idea can be used in much more complicated situations.

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,810
For that reason, it has a name.

46
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,000
It's called the bootstrap principle.
