1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,050
Now, let's have a look how big the confidence interval is.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,200
Remember, the formula for the interval is we take

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,660
the estimate plus/minus z times standard error.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:17,450
So the width of the confidence interval is given by twice z times standard error.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,800
That term, z times standard error,

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,970
is called the margin of error.

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,900
So remember, the square-root law says that

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,810
the standard error is given by sigma over square-root

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,670
n. And what that means is that the width goes down as the sample size n increases.

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,060
However, because there's a square-root there,

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,350
that means that if we want to cut the width in half,

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,400
we need four times the sample size.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,950
And likewise, if we wanted one-tenth of the width,

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,325
we would need 100 times the sample size.

15
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:56,370
Another option to make the confidence interval smaller is to make z smaller.

16
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,715
Remember, z is determined by the confidence level.

17
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:04,515
So we can make z smaller by choosing a smaller confidence level.

18
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:09,135
For example, instead of using a confidence level of 95%,

19
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,885
we could use 80%.

20
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:13,010
So there's a trade off here.

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,935
We would get a smaller confidence interval at the cost of

22
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:21,405
having less confidence that it covers the true parameter mu.

23
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:25,810
If we're interested in confidence intervals for percentages,

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,510
then there's a simple rule of thumb that allows us

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,445
to compute its confidence intervals on the fly.

26
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:33,390
The rule of thumb says,

27
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,480
just take the estimated percentage plus/minus 1 over square root sample size.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,980
The reason why this works is because sigma can be shown to be

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:50,100
never larger than one-half no matter what the population parameter p is.

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,570
So, if we plug this into our formula for the standard error,

31
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:01,560
we see that z times standard error, where z equals 2 and sigma is not more than a half,

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,275
and those 2s cancel out,

33
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:06,265
and so, we are left over with that rule of thumb.

34
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:08,920
Sometimes, newspaper articles give

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,805
confidence intervals without stating a confidence level.

36
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:19,000
In that case, it's tacitly assumed that the confidence level is 95%.
