1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Let's look at the earlier example.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,690
Suppose we poll 1,000 likely voters and

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,810
find that 58% approve of the way
the president handles his job.

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,850
So the formula for

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,670
the standard error of the percentage
is sigma over square root n.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,440
And then we can convert into a percentage
simply by multiplying with 100%.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,120
And sigma is given by square

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,040
root p(1-p) where p is the proportion
of all voters who approve.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,450
That's simply using a formula
which we looked at earlier.

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,320
So, in this case, p is unknown to us,

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,470
because we don't know the proportion
of all 140 million voters who approve.

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,250
The bootstrap principle then
says to replace sigma by s,

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,370
which is the standard deviation
of the 0/1 labels in our sample.

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,108
And if we compute that standard deviation,

15
00:00:57,108 --> 00:01:01,402
we get square root 0.58(1- 0.58),
which is 0.49.

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,590
And by the way,

17
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,520
that's exactly the same answer we would
have gotten if we had plugged in.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,630
Instead of p here,
our estimate from the sample.

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,490
So now we can write down our
95% confidence interval for p.

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,470
The formula says we take the estimate
in our sample, which is 58%.

21
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,290
Then we do plus minus z, and

22
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,880
since we have a 95% confidence level,
we take z = 2.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,770
And then we have the standard error
which has the formula given above,

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,150
so we get 0.49 divided by
square root sample size.

25
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,090
And we can write this as an interval,
54.9% to 61.1%.

26
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,790
Now let's look at our second example,

27
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,960
where we estimate the speed of light
using the average of 30 measurements.

28
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,920
So now, in this case,
what is the population or

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,000
the probability histogram
that we are sampling from?

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,450
We have to think through
the question first

31
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,680
before we can apply
the bootstrap principle.

32
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,480
Now, the reason why we get 30 different
measurements in the first place

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,181
is because each measurement
is off by a chance error.

34
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,133
So we have a model where each
measurement = the true speed

35
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:22,990
of light + a measurement error.

36
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,730
And we can think of the measurement
error as a random error.

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,670
This chance error follows some kind of
probability histogram that we don't know.

38
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,330
But we can use the bootstrap principle to
estimate the standard deviation of this

39
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,950
probability histogram.

40
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,559
Using the standard
deviation of the sample.

41
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,600
By the way, the reason why this
works is that we are looking at

42
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,900
the standard deviation, s,
of the measurements on the left hand side.

43
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,330
And we want to use that standard
deviation as an estimate.

44
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,860
Of the standard deviation sigma of the
measurement errors on the right hand side.

45
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,550
So notice there is an added term,
which is the speed of light.

46
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,560
But remember that adding a fixed
number to the measurements

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,470
will not change the standard deviation.

48
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,980
That's the reason why the bootstrap
principle works in this case.

49
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,330
Later on, we will see how we
can use the bootstrap principle

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,340
in even more complicated
situations than these.
