1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,825
Tests of significance are another mainstay of statistic analysis.

2
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:09,060
We will look at the logic behind testing and then discuss some important tests for

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,840
situations where one wants to assess one sample or compare two samples.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,595
We'll also discuss some common misunderstandings and pitfalls in testing.

5
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:23,320
Suppose we toss a coin 10 times and we get 7 tails.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,610
Now we can start wondering whether the coin is fair.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,625
So the question becomes,

8
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:34,250
is getting 7 tails sufficient evidence to conclude that the coin is biased?

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,120
This is a question that's being addressed by what's called hypothesis tests.

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,855
First, let's look at some terminology.

11
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:47,385
The null hypothesis which is sometimes written as H sub 0,

12
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:51,140
says that nothing extraordinary is going on.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,320
So that's a very generic description and

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,130
we will look at some cases to see what that means.

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,235
In the case of coin tossing,

16
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:02,940
nothing extraordinary simply means that the coin is fair.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,280
So in other words,

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,190
we can write the null hypothesis as saying

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,555
that the probability of getting tails is a half.

20
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:15,130
Then there's a second hypothesis called the alternative hypothesis.

21
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,835
It says that there's a different chance process at work.

22
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:20,715
So in our example,

23
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:23,330
the alternative hypothesis would be that

24
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,025
the probability of getting tails is not equal to one-half.

25
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:31,770
The idea of hypothesis testing is to collect data and then

26
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,925
to check whether the data are compatible with the null hypothesis or not.

27
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:41,570
If we find that the data are not compatible with the null hypothesis,

28
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,465
then we reject the null hypothesis.

29
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:46,915
Let's look at a different example.

30
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:51,170
Suppose a company develops a new drug to lower blood pressure,

31
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,880
then it tests the drug with an experiment that involves 1,000 patients.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,555
Remember, the null hypothesis always means nothing extraordinary is going on.

33
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:08,520
In this case, nothing extraordinary means that the drug has no special effect.

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,335
So, our null hypothesis, in this case,

35
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:15,640
becomes that there's no change in the blood pressure of the patients,

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,660
whereas the alternative hypothesis is,

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,630
that there's a blood pressure drop.

38
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,260
So, if you put yourselves in the shoes of the company,

39
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,175
you see that in this case,

40
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:29,990
your goal actually is to reject the null hypothesis.

41
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,580
So oftentimes, the logic behind testing is indirect.

42
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,000
One assumes that nothing extraordinary is

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,670
happening, and then hopes to reject this assumption.
