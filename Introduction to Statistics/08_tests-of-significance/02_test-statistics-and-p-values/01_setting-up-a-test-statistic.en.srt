1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,380
So now, let's look how we would go about actually doing a test.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,970
The first step is to come up with a test statistic.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,030
A test statistic measures how far away the data

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,355
are from what we would expect if the null hypothesis were true.

5
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:20,605
A common test statistic is the so-called Z-statistic.

6
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:22,855
The Z-statistic looks at

7
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:28,440
the observed outcome minus the expected outcome divided by the standard error.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,730
Here the observed outcome is a statistic

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,135
that is appropriate for assessing the null hypothesis.

10
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:38,135
For example, when we toss 10 coins,

11
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:43,750
an appropriate statistic would be the number of tails, or maybe the percent of tails.

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,515
Expected here stands for the expected value of this statistic,

13
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:52,970
assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,080
Likewise, the standard error is the standard error of

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,255
the statistic under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.

16
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:03,905
Let's look at an example.

17
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:07,330
Our statistic was the number of tails,

18
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,695
and so using the formulas for the expected values of sums,

19
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:17,610
we find that the expected value is 10 times the probability of getting a tail,

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,660
which is 5, and using the formula for the standard error,

21
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,210
we get the standard error for the sum is 1.58.

22
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:33,555
So, our x-statistic becomes the observed sum that is the number of tails, which is 7,

23
00:01:33,555 --> 00:01:37,045
minus the expected, which is 5,

24
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:43,000
divided by the standard error, and that gives us a z-value of 1.27.
