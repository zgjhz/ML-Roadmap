1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,290
The idea of a test statistic,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,910
such as a disease statistic,

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:11,230
is that large values of the absolute value of z are evidence against the null hypothesis.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,680
Why is that? So remember,

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,725
z is the observed minus expected over the standard error.

6
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:22,910
So if the absolute value of z is large, that means

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,615
there's a big discrepancy between observed and expected.

8
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:29,445
So the larger the absolute value of z is,

9
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:31,395
the stronger the evidence.

10
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:36,340
So the last piece of hypothesis testing that's missing is we have to find

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:42,030
a way that converts the size of z into some measure of evidence.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,975
And that measure is given by the p-value,

13
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:48,610
or sometimes, it's called the observed significance level.

14
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,920
The p-value is the probability of getting a value of

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,970
the z-statistic that is as extreme or more extreme than the observed one,

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,135
under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.

17
00:01:00,135 --> 00:01:03,250
So that sentence might be a bit difficult to digest,

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,405
and it's best to look at some examples.

19
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:07,280
To see what's going on,

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,495
we already know that under the null hypothesis,

21
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:15,840
the z-statistic follows the standard normal curve by the central limit theorem.

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,970
That is simply because we have

23
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,160
an observed sum minus expected sum over the standard error.

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,910
So this is simply standardizing a sum,

25
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,780
and we know by the central limit theorem,

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,300
that follows a normal curve.

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,965
What that means is that the p-value can be computed using normal approximation.

28
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:37,175
Let's look at this picture here.

29
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:39,105
We have a standard normal curve,

30
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:42,650
and then suppose, we have an observed z value here.

31
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,780
And now, the p-value is the probability of

32
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,010
getting z as extreme or more extreme than the observed one,

33
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,875
so that would be here,

34
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,140
or to the left of -z.

35
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,585
So the p-value is this shaded area there.

36
00:01:56,585 --> 00:02:00,550
And now, you get the idea that as z gets large,

37
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,975
that shaded area gets small.

38
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:08,255
So a small shaded area is evidence against the null hypothesis.

39
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:10,860
Oftentimes, the criterion for rejecting

40
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,845
the null hypothesis is having a p-value that is smaller than 5%.

41
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,360
Then the technical term for this is,

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,725
that the result is statistically significant.

43
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:25,135
Let's look at our example about coin tossing.

44
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:30,175
We have an observed z-statistic of 1.27.

45
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:32,230
So, that's somewhere here.

46
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,625
Turns out, the area to the right of 1.27 is 10.2%.

47
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:45,145
So the p-value is the probability of getting a normal outcome that's larger than 1.27,

48
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:48,960
or smaller than -1.27.

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,120
And since the normal curve is symmetric,

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,890
we simply double the shaded area.

51
00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,960
So we find that the p-value in this case is twice 10.2%.

52
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,020
So it's 20.4%.

53
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,265
So what would be the conclusion of this case?

54
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:09,005
Well, 20.4% is not smaller than 5%,

55
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:12,235
so we would not reject the null hypothesis.

56
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:15,050
And so, remember, the interpretation of the p-value,

57
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,605
if the coin is fair, then there's a 20.4% chance to get such an extreme outcome.

58
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:23,995
So in other words, that's actually not very surprising.

59
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:28,675
And that means, there's not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

60
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,485
But keep in mind that the p-value does not

61
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:34,635
give the probability that the null hypothesis is true.

62
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:38,525
That's because the null hypothesis is either true or not,

63
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:40,815
and there are no chances involved in that one.

64
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:43,390
Rather, what the p-value does is,

65
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,765
it gives the probability of seeing

66
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:50,835
a statistic which is as extreme or even more extreme than the one you observe,

67
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:54,000
under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.
