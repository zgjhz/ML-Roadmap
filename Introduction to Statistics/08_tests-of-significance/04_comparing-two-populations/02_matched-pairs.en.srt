1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Now, let's look at these questions.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,055
Do husbands tend to be older than their wives?

3
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:07,020
Well, we can collect some data,

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,200
and here are the ages of five couples.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,000
What you see is well,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,495
there's a husband of age 43,

7
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:17,490
whose wife is 41.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,910
So, there's a two-year age difference.

9
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,420
And then we have a couple where the husband is 71,

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,070
and the wife is 70.

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,960
Then we have 32 and 31.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,150
68 and 66, and 27 and 26.

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,800
So, it looks like the husband is always a little bit older than his wife.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,920
So, how would we analyze those data?

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,890
Clearly, we have two samples.

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,760
There's the sample of the husbands' ages,

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,595
and then there's a sample of the wives' ages.

18
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:52,815
But of course the problem is that in this case,

19
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:54,825
the two samples are not independent.

20
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:58,170
The reason they are not independent is that while

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,470
the husband's age is typically a bit larger than the wife's age,

22
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,420
they tend to be closer together.

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,805
For example, here the couple is both in their 70s,

24
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:10,680
and then there's another couple in their 20s.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,060
So, this similarity in age makes the two samples dependent.

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,580
So, there's one major assumption of

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,850
having two independent samples that is not met in that case.

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,614
But even if we could use the two-sample z-test,

29
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:27,165
it would probably be not significant.

30
00:01:27,165 --> 00:01:32,205
And the reason is that the age differences are quite small,

31
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:36,435
but the variation within each group is quite big.

32
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:40,170
For example, husbands' age are 43, 71, 32.

33
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,410
So, there's quite some fluctuation in there.

34
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,915
And what the two-sample z-test does is,

35
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:51,490
it compares the differences to the fluctuations within each population.

36
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,030
And in this case, the differences are small

37
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,475
compared to the fluctuations within each population.

38
00:01:57,475 --> 00:02:02,050
It turns out there's a very simple solution for these types of data.

39
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,810
Since we have paired data,

40
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:11,030
we can simply analyze the differences obtained from each pair with a simple t-test.

41
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,080
So, again let's start out with specifying our null hypothesis,

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,760
which would be that the difference in population means is 0.

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,745
Then the t-test would look at the average of the differences,

44
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,900
subtract off the expected value,

45
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,630
which is 0 under the null hypothesis,

46
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,500
and divide by the standard error of the average.

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,950
Now, the formula for the standard error of the average is

48
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,040
the standard deviation in the population

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,280
of the differences divided by square root sample size.

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,325
And again, we would simply estimate sigma by

51
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:53,665
the sample standard deviation of the differences, which is 0.55.

52
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:59,745
Plugging this in, we find that our t-statistic is 5.69.

53
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:04,395
Now, we look up the t-table on some software,

54
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,470
and what we have to do is,

55
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:14,200
we have to find the area to the right in the t-table from 5.69 on,

56
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,210
and again, this curve is student t-distribution with four degrees of freedom,

57
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,700
which is one less than the sample size,

58
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,055
and we would look that up and find the area there is 0.2%.

59
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:31,905
So, the p-value in this case,

60
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:34,260
is double that which is 0.4%

61
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,490
and clearly this is strong evidence to reject the null.

62
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,380
So, it turns out that the paired t-test is very powerful in that situation.

63
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,795
Again, remember that we do not need

64
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:48,765
an assumption of independence between the two samples,

65
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:50,760
rather what happens here is that

66
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,570
the independence assumptions is in the sampling of the pairs.

67
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,920
Now, what would happen if we didn't know the age difference,

68
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,520
but only if the husband was older than his wife or not?

69
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,910
In that case, we can still assess the evidence.

70
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,340
We would have to write the null hypothesis a little bit different.

71
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,335
We would say half the husbands in the population are older than their wives.

72
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:17,670
And the reason why we write it down that way is because

73
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,140
we are now only interested whether the husband is older or not,

74
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,030
and we specify the proportion of husbands who are older which is half.

75
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,890
So, that hints that we are looking at 0/1 labels because we are counting

76
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,655
how many husbands are older than their wives.

77
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:37,560
And then we can just use a simple z-test.

78
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,650
Remember, this is really the same thing that we looked

79
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,310
at when we tested whether a coin is fair.

80
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,765
So, the z-statistic is simply the sum of the 1s,

81
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:50,890
minus the expected values,

82
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,540
and so we have n trials,

83
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,740
and each has a chance of a half of coming up 1,

84
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,275
divided by the standard error of the sum.

85
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:03,280
So, in this case, a label 1 would mean that a husband is older than the wife,

86
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,165
and a label 0 would be the other way around.

87
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,915
So, the z-statistic is 2.24,

88
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:13,070
and now we can draw a normal curve,

89
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,810
and we have to look up the area to the right of 2.24,

90
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:23,470
and that area is 1.25%.

91
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,160
And the p-value is double that.

92
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
So, it's still significant,

93
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,200
but not quite as significant as the one before.

94
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,095
The reason why it's not as significant is because

95
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:38,860
we don't use the information that's contained in the age difference.

96
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,040
We only use the information whether the husband is older or not.

97
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,260
This test is very famous.

98
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,135
It's called a sign test.

99
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:52,570
The way to think about it is the coin tossing example we looked earlier.

100
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,330
The coin tossing analogy makes it very easy to

101
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,800
interpret the sign test even for people who are not experts in statistics.

102
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,370
And that's one of the main reasons why it's so popular.
