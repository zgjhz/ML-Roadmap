1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,375
So, let's apply testing to a taste experiment.

2
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:10,275
It's actually surprisingly difficult to distinguish Coke and Pepsi by taste alone,

3
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:13,790
that means you're not allowed to see what's on the can.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,025
I did an experiment about this in a class at Stanford.

5
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:21,060
We had 10 cups that were filled at random with either Coke or Pepsi.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,310
Then, a student volunteer tasted each of

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,955
the 10 cups and correctly named the contents of 7.

8
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:28,460
So, the question is,

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,154
whether this is sufficient evidence to conclude

10
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:34,410
that the student can tell apart Coke and Pepsi.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,100
So, what's the null hypothesis in this situation?

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,005
Remember the generic expression for null hypothesis,

13
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:45,370
is nothing extraordinary is going on.

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,735
In this case, that would mean that the student does not have

15
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:52,490
any special ability to tell Coke and Pepsi apart.

16
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,894
In other words, the student would just be guessing.

17
00:00:55,894 --> 00:01:01,220
Now, we have to write this down in a way where we can introduce our methodology.

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,145
So, we know that when we count things we will introduce 0/1 labels.

19
00:01:06,145 --> 00:01:07,635
So, in this case,

20
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:12,195
we may have 1 for a correct answer and 0 for a wrong answer.

21
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:16,770
Then, the null hypothesis would simply say that the probability of a correct answer is

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,335
a half and the alternative would be

23
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:22,580
that the probability of a correct answer is larger than a half.

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,400
This is called a one-sided test, and that simply means that

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,670
the alternative hypothesis is on one side of the null and not on both sides.

26
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,115
So, in this case the z-statistic looks exactly like the one we had for coin tossing.

27
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:40,055
We have an observed sum which is 7,

28
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:44,050
the expected sum in 10 trials would be 5,

29
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,500
and then we have the standard error of the sum in

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,115
the denominator and we found that to be 1.58.

31
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:54,765
So, the z-statistic comes down to 1.27.

32
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:57,715
So, next we have to find the p-value.

33
00:01:57,715 --> 00:02:00,170
So, we have a standard normal curve,

34
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,220
and we look at a z-value of 1.27,

35
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,375
and the area to the right turns out to be 10.2%.

36
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,720
And remember, we do a one-sided test, so

37
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,435
we're not going to trouble with that one.

38
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:18,605
And finally, the conclusion is since 10.2% is not smaller than 5%,

39
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,984
we don't reject the null hypothesis.

40
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:23,710
So, there's not enough evidence to convince

41
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,960
us that the student can distinguish Coke and Pepsi.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,835
For this experiment, it might actually be also appropriate to do a two-sided test.

43
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:36,670
That is, we would look at the alternative that

44
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,755
the probability of a correct answer is different from a half.

45
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:45,700
This alternative would correspond to a student who can distinguish Coke and Pepsi,

46
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,435
but who may confuse which is which.

47
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:52,130
For example, such a student might get one correct answer.

48
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,150
So, very few correct answers are actually

49
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,490
evidence that the student can distinguish Coke and Pepsi but he would mix up the two,

50
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,725
and that actually happened once when I did the experiment.

51
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,300
In general, you have to think carefully ahead of time,

52
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,795
whether the alternative should be one-sided or two-sided.

53
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:13,875
Keep in mind that for a two-sided test,

54
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,080
the p-value gets doubled.

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,090
If one does a two-sided test and it's not significant,

56
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,820
then it may be tempting to declare that one wanted to do a one-sided test in

57
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:30,675
the first place, and cut the p-value in half to get it under the 5% threshold,

58
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:32,510
that is not okay.

59
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,080
So, you have to declare ahead of time,

60
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,250
whether you want to do a one-sided test or a two-sided test.
