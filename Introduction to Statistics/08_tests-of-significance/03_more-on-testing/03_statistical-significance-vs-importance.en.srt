1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
Here are some more facts on testing.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,295
The first one is particularly important.

3
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:08,250
It says that statistical significance is not

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,475
the same thing as practical importance. What does that mean?

5
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:14,495
Suppose in our example,

6
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:17,435
the sample average of lead concentrations

7
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:21,055
is just slightly above the health standard of 15 parts per billion.

8
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:25,990
For example, the sample average could be 15.05 parts per billion.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,320
Now, that may not be very relevant.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,595
After all, it's essentially the same thing as 15,

11
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:37,530
but it may turn out that a statistical test we just did is highly significant.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,965
How can that be? Well, a statistical significance

13
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:45,440
simply says that we can be confident that the effect is there.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,570
It doesn't say how big the effect is.

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,195
So, how can it be that a small difference such as going to

16
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:58,235
15.05 will result in a highly significant test?

17
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:00,650
Well, the answer is the square-root law.

18
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,710
A large sample size makes the standard error

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,660
small because the sample size is in the denominator.

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,385
And with a small standard error,

21
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:13,870
we may quickly get a very significant test result.

22
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,620
For that reason, it's helpful to complement the test with a confidence interval.

23
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,120
In that case, we might get a confidence interval that, for example,

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,720
goes from 15.02 all the way to 15.08,

25
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,810
and that, in effect, tells us that we can be

26
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,600
confident that we are not far away from the health limit.

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,960
It turns out that there's a general connection between confidence intervals and tests.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,910
A 95% confidence interval contains all values for

29
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,570
the null hypothesis that will not be

30
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,840
rejected by a two-sided test at the 5% significance level.

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,685
Now, that's a difficult statement to digest.

32
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:59,475
The best way to think about this is in terms of the previous example,

33
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:02,845
rejecting the null hypothesis of 15

34
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:07,335
is the same as saying 15 is not in the confidence interval.

35
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:12,410
Finally, keep in mind that there are two ways that a test can result in a wrong decision.

36
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,390
It may be that the null hypothesis is true but we erroneously reject it.

37
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,490
This is called a type I error,

38
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,295
or you may know it under the name false positive.

39
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:25,585
The second type of error, which is called type II error

40
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:30,520
occurs if the null hypothesis is not true, but we fail to reject it.

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,120
Remember, the standard rule for rejecting

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,260
a null hypothesis is when the p-value falls below 5%.

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,710
If that's the rule, that means that the probability of a type I error is,

44
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,940
at most, 5%.
