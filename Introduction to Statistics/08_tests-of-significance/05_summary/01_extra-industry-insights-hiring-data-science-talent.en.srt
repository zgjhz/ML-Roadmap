1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,350
Data science to me is more of, it's a tool in the toolbox, okay?

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,840
And so, as a carpenter,

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,060
you can build framing for houses,

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,100
you can build wooden fences,

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,040
you can make wonderful custom cabinetry,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,705
you can make children's toys.

7
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:18,040
But all of that comes out of sort of having

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,765
that basic knowledge of how to use those woodworking tools.

9
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:25,640
But there's obviously a lot of mastery that goes into those different disciplines.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,160
And so for us, it's more than just the knowledge of how to use these tools and

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,815
how to explore datasets and make meaningful predictions or pull insights from them,

12
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:39,400
but rather that has to be connected to medicine and biology,

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,410
and sort of this interpretive aspect of what we're doing.

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,645
And so when we look for people that we bring into our company from a science perspective,

15
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:50,610
not only do they have to have that meaningful understanding of

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,195
computer science and sort of how to use these toolsets,

17
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:57,920
but also, what are even the questions we want to ask of that data?

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,330
How are we going to construct these systems to sort of go

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,990
after solving these very complex biological problems?

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,000
We're looking for that capability in the mind of a single person.
